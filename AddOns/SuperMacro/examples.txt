I have some equipment that adds to my healing spell... unfortunately, they aren't good for anything else, so I have this macro to use the "healing" equipment, and call the healer macro, and then in 7 and 8 seconds, re-equip the regular armor:

"SuperHealer"
/equip Durable Pants of Healing
/equip Tracker's Gloves of Healing
/changeactionbar 1
/in 7 /equip Glyphed MItts
/in 8 /equip Warchief Kilt
/print "SPECIAL HEALING"
/click MacroClick_Healer

"Healer"
/cast [modifier:alt] Lesser Healing Wave
/cast [nomodifier,nocombat] Healing Wave
/cast [nomodifier,combat] Lesser Healing Wave
