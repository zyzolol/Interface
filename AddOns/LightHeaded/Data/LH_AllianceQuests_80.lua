Explorer's League Researcher: I don't think it can top the one time where he told us that he'd heard that Arthas's \"cousin's\" skeleton was frozen beneath a glacier in Winterspring. I'll never forgive you for that one, Letoll. I mean honestly... Arthas's cousin?\

I'm not missing the point. After you fork out 30g you have a long quest chain to do which involves killing several bosses in the 70 instances, if you don't manage to get a Horrid Dreams, Continuum Blade or whatever else by the time you actually finish this chain, you're severely unlucky.\

Also, putting +40 spell damage on whatever weapon you get (from Horrid Dreams/Continuum onwards) makes the +spell damage difference completely obselete, and this, a waste of bag space.\

The fact is, it doesn't matter where you kill them, wheather you put the totem down before or in combat, wheather you loot or not.

Doing this quest will also indirectly net you reputation with Kurenai +10, +11 (if you're Human). Rach Orge kill gives you reputation with Kurenai.\
\
I'm currently getting through Revered with Kurenai just by grinding these orges for their warbeads which I'll turn into for The Consortium for their reputation. I think that's a good deal... I didn't notice that I was getting reputation with Kurenai until I turned Revered with them during an Orge grinding session. When you glow green, and a noise pops up - it tends to wake you up and take notice. :)\
\
If you're going for Exalted with The Consortium, You might as well grind these Orges because you'll be killing two reputation grinds at one time.\

Grishna Falconwings give the buff, but only if you are standing within Melee range.  For casters, make sure you're close enough to take a swing at the Falconwing.  If you're out in Wand or Spell range, you won't get the buff.\

As has been mentioned below, you can get all 4 points on a single buff if you're familiar with them.  I reccomend a flying mount to achieve that though.",

The Understanding Ravenspeech buff will replace your tracking type (only proffesional ones I need confirmation about tracking huumanoids, giant, etc) and can not be dispelled by right clicking on it. When finished it will re-use your previous tracking type (I repeat I have tested it only with proffesional tracking mining, herbalism and not with player tracking system like humanoid tracking or elemental)",
    "106078089320808932007/05/10 12:28:54arcoSome minor corrections on what I've read above:\
\
First Post: The coordinates for the first and second prophecies are correct [(39,17) and (42,22) respectively], but the prophecies aren't on the very top story of the tree towers - they're on the story just below.  They're tiny little versions of the regular owl/bird totems you see in Arakkoa camps, on top of little prayer blankets.  I was confused for a few minutes checking all the tree towers looking for them.\
\
Other post: Someone said that the \"soul attraction\" buff is gained upon killing your first Arakkoa in the area - not true.  You gain the buff as soon as you enter the Grishnath area.  I used my flying mount to go over the mountain, to avoid the mobs in the tunnel, and I gained it while still in flight as soon as I neared the ground.  As long as you're in the area you have this buff - leave the area, lose the buff.  You can only gain \"Understanding Ravenspeech\" while you have \"Soul Attraction.\"\
\
That being said, I did this with a hunter in about 5 minutes.  After figuring out where each of the totems was it was a breeze.  I don't think any of the Arakkoa we killed failed to give us the \"Understanding Ravenspeech\" buff.  That didn't seem like a problem.  If you have a flying mount this quest is even easier - fly to one of the prophecies, dismount, grab an arakkoa, kill it, get credit for that prophecy, mount, go to the next one.  It makes the ones up in the tree towers especially easy, as you can fly right onto the tower, kill one of the patrolling arakkoa, get credit, and jump off.",

Previous posters who have said that you have to kill a Falconwing are correct. I was killing and killing and not getting the buff, so came here to get some help, saw that tip, killed one Falconwing and got the buff off the first one I killed.",

    "11059151086501510862007/09/10 00:37:02PaddyjackHere is a great trick to solo this guy (ranged dps only, sorry)\
\
Go to the summoning point directly south of O'grila. A few step to the west of the summoning point, there are two blade structures sticking out of the mountains where you can kite the guardian. So, after summoning him, you climb one of these structure with the guardian in tow, and when he is close to you, you jump to the second structure. What happen next is the guardian won't follow you directly but doubleback to reach you from another route. Shoot him down at your leisure while he is moving around the structures, and when he is close to you again, jumb back to the first structure. Rince and repeat. All you need is some bandages and mana pots. I did it twice this way without any sweat. As a hunter, it took me around 6 minutes to kill him this way.\

\
I can confirm that it spawns even if you mess up on the clicking, I tried soloing one by kiting it to the ogre camp. (That -might- just be possible if it uses it's aoe attack and aggros them, but it didn't and I had to give up and Feign Death when my HP got too low from it's ranged rock throw attack).",
    "1105910659221935002007/06/18 17:04:12tanukyActually, there is much better tactic to do this q. Simply have 4 people in corners, and let them remember the ORDER of clicking, not colours. People will just watch the sparks, and if third spark goes under your feet, it means you wait until 2 your colleagues click (you will see 2 sparks), then you click.\

    "1105988668110886682007/05/23 16:49:42doomscytheThe best way to do this without screwing it up is to watch the spark and type into chat the first letter of the color the spark is. For example, if it sparks yellow, green, green, blue, yellow, as each color flashes, quickly type the first letter of each color into a chat message, like this: y g g b y.\

Two people each standing in the middle of two buttons can easily spawn this, you don't need 4 people.  If you find the right spot, you can reach both buttons without moving (this is not required though, you can still move enough to reach the buttons even with the debuff). \

\
The boss drops an Apexxis Crystal (not to be confused with Apexxis Shard) as well as some random green / blue loot.  The Apexxis Crystal is used to purchase some of the reputation reward loot from the Ogri'la quartermaster.  If you are pugging this boss, I would recommend giving the person who summoned the boss the Apexxis Crystal, since that person had to spend 35 shards to summon.  Meanwhile, everybody should get a chance at the green / blue loot that drops as a reward for having participated.",

I lucked out and got through it as a hunter, with 2 Feign Deaths and a pet res while the spirit hunter was still tanking the boss.  Therefore, if you can, make a dash through and clear the area as best as you can, prior to accepting the quest and taking the spirit hunter with you.\
\
Just to summarize the points mentioned above. \
\
Veneratus has a lot of health, as a 69 hunter i DPS'd him for 30 secs and bearly got him to 1/2 health then i aggroed him and a patrol.\
\
I FD'd, my pet died and the spirit hunter easily tanked him for 15-20 secs while i waited for patrols to clear.\
\
I thought i was a goner, however, the spirit hunter was still at over 2/3 health. So jumped up, res pet and started again, and just got him down as i aggroed another patrol, cleared by feigning death again.\
\
This was a fair old fight, more than just a tank and spank. You do have a lot of time to think and manage it due to the large health pools of both the spirit hunter and Veneratus. So take your time, max the DPS and try your best to keep clear of patrols. I think the challenge is more in managing the adds rather than Veneratus. I think this was nicely set up to be a different challenge by blizzard.",
    "10540103853101038532007/06/13 18:30:49kiddxLooks like as of 2.1 there is a glitch, if you have a pet already when you get up the hill, he hits it a couple of times and then just stops. My VW was there too and he just stopped so they both sat there while i fought it alone and then when I died he started to fight again. Not sure about this 10 min timer for help? But obviously you cant control him yet you dont lose your pet ..\
\
I tried it by dismissing the pet then asking for another and i still have no control, the guy walks up the mountain he attacks stuff, then he just stops then starts again.. The timer about asking for help I guess means you have no control? maybe i have to wait 10 minutes? pretty annoying at this point he will tank for about 30 secs then just stop and the demon pounds on him until he dies or i get aggro but he wont attack it.",

Moral?  If you die (likely) and come back to res and see the quest mob there, attack and pull it to safety then kill it easily.

The super short version is:  Clear area mobs.  Put on Fireshield.  After, unloading on Culuthus, run him in circles around the northern \"structure\" on the rise (bluff, whatever you call it).  Use \"structure\" to avoid geting hit by LOS fireattack of his.  \
\
Only use Fireblast spell.  You can squeeze in short channeled spells after a minute or two.  Fight alst 2-3 minutes.  I think it took me a little over 2 minutes.\

That's it!  Just run the same circle, around the same building, using the same spell, over and over.\

I recommend using fire res aura and judge with light as his felfire is really the only issue (and I hesitate to call it an issue). The trick is really just to make some of your mana outlast his. Once he felfires his way to OOMland, he's a piece of cake. I used Divine Shield when I hit 6k health and bandaged, then later on when he was fully OOM popped blessing of protection and bandaged again. The first 1/2 I sealed with Vengeance to add a little extra damage without spending a lot of mana. The final 1/2 of the battle I sealed with wisdom so I could Exorcise as it cooled down while he was meleeing. Once he's out of mana, just keep hacking away and watch your health.

It's true most, if not all mobs have an average of 20-25% chance to drop these...but I found out that the most annoying of Zangarmarsh creatures hold the key to gaining many Unidentified plants.\

If you've ever done an instance in Zangarmasrh, you know of the lake to swim through has a plentiful amount of Mudfin frenzys' that every so often shoot up at you.\
\
Turns out these buggers each have a 20-25% chance to drop an Unidentified Plant, and being they are all 1/4 of a regular mob, to AoE them down in a sense technically quadruples your chance of finding an Unidentified Plant.\
\
I farmed these guys in bear form with no hassle and hit some mobs of 4 with no drops, to tanking a mob of 8 getting 7 drops...the odds are in your favor if you're out for the Grinding of Unidentified Plants.\

First off, you must gather one Apexis Shard (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32569). Then you need to locate an Apexis Monument. Around this monument, you will find 4 Apexis Relics. Go to one of them and stand on the white globe in the middle of the relic (Under the crystal). This way you will make sure you are in reach of all 4 buttons.\
\
Click the Apexis Relic and you will be asked to use your Apexis Shard. After a few seconds a beam from the relic will hit one of the buttons around it. When the beam has hit a button, you simply push the button it hit.\

Next level, the relic will hit two buttons. When that is done, you must push the buttons in the order the relic showed you. Continue this untill the quest is complete. I think it completed for me at level 5.\
\
To make this easier, have a second computer with a text editor. Asign a number for each of the buttons from 1 to 4. I.e.: You get this order: 1, 1, 4, 3, 1, 2. Type this in your text editor while the beam hits. Relax, and push those buttons in WoW while you look at your text editor for the order. If you dont have a secondary computer, try a cell phone. Good luck!",

\
I started out in cat form, got 5 quick combo points on him, ripped, and then backed away. By this point, he had me at half life. I rooted him, backed off, healed, and went bear form. When he got me down to about 30% life, I hit entangling roots, waited for it to proc, and then backed away and healed again, etc. \
\
He's rootable, sleepable, and stunable. I don't think he should be a prob for either balance or feral druids. \

FYI: He has about 20,000 HP.",

\
I can confirm that he is stunnable, blindable, and you can snare him with crippling poison as a rogue.  Also, rogues: make sure that you stealth immediately after summoning him, as you're automatically brought into combat a couple seconds afterward.\
\
In earlier comments that are now rated down, it was also noted that druids are able to sleep him and mages can use their slow spell on him.\
\
Additionally, he was capable of hits in the 650 range and melee crits around 1300 on leather.  He has no noteworthy abilities.\

Strat:\
\
1: Clear around the bones, he WILL pull most of what you dont kill.\
\
2: Summon the dragon and back up so you dont get crit in the face right off the bat.\

3: If you have a boar, have it charge+growl to generate a lot of aggro.  Immediatly put scorpid sting on because the dragon will hit for over 600, even with 45% reduction.  Keep mend pet up at all times\
\
4: At about 70%, your pet should be rather low on health.  Trap the dragon and keep mend pet up. Once your pet is at full hp, Misdirection, pop all cooldowns+trinkets, and aimed-shot, multi-shot, arcane shot.\
\
5: Keep dps'ing untill your pet is at 25% and trap again.  Keep mend pet up , but this time feign death to wipe your aggro.  Send the pet in, and keep dps'ing.\
\
6: Repeat 5 as many times as you have to until the dragon dies. Congrats on the kill!\

\
Used the horn, he came at me.  Judged Crusader, then put up Seal of Righteousness.  Judged Righteousness whenever it was up, and dropped consecrates about 3-4 seconds after they ran out.  Kept Holy Shield active throughout.  Used Retribution Aura, Righteous Fury(improved), and Blessing of Sanctuary.\
\
He got me to about 50%, he was just under 60.  Hammer of Justice and bandage to nearly full.\
\
Bit later we were tied for health around 30%.  Popped Divine Shield and FoL'd myself back to full and finished him off.  I could probably have gone all out at this point- Avenging Wrath, Avenger's Shield, outright spamming of Consecrate, but I had gotten this far with a somewhat aggressive(for prot) strat and figured it was time to play it safe and coast to the win.\
\
Really easy.  Was very low on mana at the end.  I could have eased this by using Seal of Wisdom or Seal of Light, and judging one of them as well. Could have also done without the consecrates and saved some mana.  But I went for a more aggressive tactic to bring him down faster, and he's wimpy enough that you have some leeway for that.\

He's tougher to bring down than the typical level 70 mob, but nowhere near the difficulty of the average 70 elite.",

    "10899153838101538382007/09/16 15:16:08HaveyJoeI think that transmutation mastery would be more appealing if Blizzard gave some more perks besides a pretty slim chance of a multiple transmute. Some ideas:\
\
1. Reduce the cooldown to, say, 12 hours for transmutation masters, while keeping it at 23-24 hours for alchemists with no mastery or a different mastery,\
\
2. Increase the proc rate,\
\
3. Keep the cooldown as is, but with transmutation mastery put the different transmutes on separate cooldowns. For example, with transmutation mastery I could transmute a primal might, earthstorm diamond and an arcanite bar all in one day,\
\
4. Etc., <insert other transmutation mastery idea here> or\
\
5. Some combination of these. \
\
It seems to me that the real issue here is not so much the proc rate as is the fact that doing a single transmute leaves you unable to do ANY transmutes for pretty much a whole day. On the other hand, potion/elixir masters can make as many potions, elixirs or flasks as they want, whenever they want so long as they have the mats, which makes their procs seem to abound by comparison. \

It would seem that you can drop a mastery with out droping alch all together.",
    "1090710960221960242007/06/22 22:55:08WirelessConfirmed. Seems that if you have already completed a previous alchemy mastery (Elixir, Potion, Transmutation) you can drop it at the NPC that you finished you mastery quest (eg: Elixir mastery was the bird-person in lower city in shattrath) for 150g the first time (not sure if it goes up, like talent resets.) Then you need to go the the NPC that gives you the mastery of your choice (eg: Transmutation is in netherstorm) and just talk to them. You dont need mats for that quest. I still have my four primal mights.",

    "109073200061238502007/02/07 02:02:09HeathcliffIf you don't plan on getting any rare alchemy recipes, then transmutation mastery is the one to do.\
\
Look at it this way... assuming everyone can make a potion, then its price should vary with the price of the herbs on the AH. The same thing happens with the enchantments people can learn from NPCs. No one can craft any better than anyone else; no one can do it cheaper. If you have a mastery in potions then you can make the potion for slightly cheaper.. Assuming one in 4 potions gives you 1 extra, then you're producing at 80% the cost. However, if two people can produce at 80% the cost, then they're basically just competing with each other to see who is more comfortable making less money. However if you're one of a few with an alchemy recipe, then you're only competing with those people... and if you're the only one of those with potion spec, then if they are ALWAYS selling at 0% markup on their potions, you can ALWAYS afford to make 20% profit selling at their price... or make 15% profit and sell for slightly below theirs (so yours will always sell first).\
\
Transmutes are different, however. Since they're on cooldown, you the market's supply is limited by the number of alchemists.\
\
Ideally your guild should have one of each spec and the rest transmutes; and have your potion and elixir specs in on every raid. This way when either a potion or elixir recipe drops it isn't \"wasted\" on a person who can't proc on it (and your guild won't miss out on that 1 extra every 4).",

\
I'm saying this, based on my own experience, from today 2nd of May 2007. I've been Elixir master for 3 months, but today I wanted to go Transmutation Mastery. I dropped my Elixir Mastery at the Alchemy Trainer in Shattrath, gathered the 4 Primal Mights, and went to Thrallmar to gain the first step (this), but there was no quest. Then I went to Zarehi (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22427) in Netherstorm, and for my surprise I was able to gain the mastery without doing anything but clicking a button. So I saved my 4 Primal Mights, and can now use for incoming Spellstrike :D",

\
So potentially you don't have to wait for a server reset in order to give it a shot.  I personally tested it and it is resetting in the estimated time frame.  \

First try it bugged, I put up a ticket.\
While waiting in the tomb it did reset before I got the GM response posted above.\
My group had left so I tried soloing it and failed. (2nd Try)\
Waited about 10 minutes and it reset.  Tried it again, bugged out.(3rd Try)\
Waited again, it resets.  4th Try with a group, and it bugs out.\
Waited 10 minutes (timed it this time) and it reset, 5th try, going with a group.\
\
EXTREMLY Important thing to Note if your waiting with a group at the quest area in question.  Everytime the event resets, the entire room has a chance to respawn all at once.  Caused a near wipe, starting the event does after a few seconds kills off all Ethreals in the room.\

\
I just solo'ed as a 66 UD shadow priest.  Was fairly easy.\
\
Always kept one shacked, and dotted and burned down everything else.  I was able to get a drink in early in the event, and a bandage before the harbinger.  I pulled the Harbinger with my shadowfiend, and then started dotting him up, he died just as he entered the circle, and the quest completed.\
\
Easy peasy.\

    "10842140638201406382007/08/19 14:35:03ShihliFor anyone still having bug problems, here's how I fixed it - your mileage may vary but it worked for me.\
\
At the base of the ramp into the room, there's a semi-circular pattern on the ground.  My lv. 70 mage friend and I (lv. 65 Shaman) stood in the center of the semi-circular pattern after starting the quest.  I dropped a Magma totem and she was spamming rank 1 AoE.\
\
The \"bug\" is that mobs associated with the quest (including the \"vengeful harbinger\" mob himself) instantly spawn, then despawn.  However, we would aggro the mobs *before* they despawned.\
\
Tricky thing was, when the Harbinger spawned, he became bugged - we brought him to 59 health and he wouldn't die.  So my mage friend dragged him back into the center of the circle and tried to kill him - didn't work.  So she proceeded to just run away and let him evade bug out (she ran to the back of the room).  The harbinger then proceeded to float into the center of the ring, get \"zapped\" and allow the quest to complete.\
\
So in short, here is how you can un-bug it:\
\
1)  Get a friend with a good amount of AoE.\
2)  Start quest.\
3)  Stand at the base of the ramp entrance into the room and begin spamming AoE once the Ancient Draenei Guardian spawns.\
4)  When the \"Vengeful Harbinger\" spawns, drag him into the back of the room and kill him in the center of the ring - if he goes to low health and cannot die, just run away from him and let him get \"zapped\" by the ring.\
5)  Profit!",

    "10842102205501022052007/06/11 01:57:11Excellent1I just completed this quest a short time ago. Basically, I have been trying it every other level or so since around 64, so I've tried all the comments and suggestions posted here and nothing seemed to work.\
\
What I found out tonight, and subsequently tested by helping another group, is this:\
\
1. Kill the 3 waves anywhere, doesn't matter, as long as they don't kill the robot. You do NOT need to kill them inside circle for the Harbringer to spawn.\
2. Once the 3rd wave of mobs is down, back up to the very back wall of the tomb area. Let the Vengeful Harbringer path THROUGH the robot, who stands at the entrance to the circle.\
3. The Vengeful Harbringer will stand in the exact center of the circle, which is where you need to kill him. If you can get him to die in the middle of the circle, the robot will then walk to the middle of the circle, strike the corpse of the VH with a lightning bolt, then die.\
4. If done correctly, the corpse / spirit of the Vengeful Harbringer will float up and around the room and eventually spawn the spirit in the middle of the room that you can turn in to.\
\
The first time I did this correctly, I was completely stoked to have this completed. It wasn't until I helped the next group that I realized the position the Harbringer paths to (center of circle) and dies in (center of the circle) are critical to success.\

Just for completing that quest (talking to him) you get over 4700 XP points. That alone will instantly level up a level 1 toon several levels!!! Talk about a quick way to get up to level 5. \

Not sure if Blizzard intended this level 60 quest for level 1 characters but it works. If you want to skip the leveling in the n00b zones, just do this quest and you'll zoom up a few levels instantly and can start tradeskilling right away!!! \

Even on a level 8 character, you can practically gain an entire level from finishing the subsequent quest in Moonglade. It's worth about a 1/2 a level at level 13 too.",

\
First, turn on \"Aspect of the Viper\" and turn off \"Growl\" and all damaging special attacks on your pet.  You want \"Viper\" because it's a lenghty fight and no special abilities so you can aggro him easier.\
\
Clear the entire area immediately before the attempt.\
Run up, send in the pet (with \"Growl\" turned off) and activate \"Mend Pet\" right away (apart from making sure that your pet won't die, this will aggro him towards you in case he's out of sight after you have jumped down).\
Put the pet on \"Stay\" and jump down the ledge.  Chances are he'll already be following you because of the aggro from \"Mend Pet\".  If not, wait until he does or start shooting right away if you have an LoS to him.\
Be careful not to fall down the ledge to your right.  When he gets close, feign death.  He will not reset but run back towards your pet which is conveniently parked at his spawn location.  Rinse, repeat until dead.\
\
If your pet dies, you lose because he'll reset to full health as soon as you FD.  The video posted above will help you getting familiar with the setup, but I think it's pretty clear anyway when you're at the location yourself.\
\
This is actually a prime example how to exploit pathing to effectively solo difficult mobs with a hunter.  Ironically non of the quest rewards are especially appealing to us ;-).",

I think this is something that they did by an automated process rather than manually, based on whether a groundspawn is *specifically* for a quest, because it appears that the chests containing the cipher are a different spawn object than the other chests. In any case, as of the patch you can tell which chests have the cipher, because they sparkle.\

Note that your first turn-in of Coilfang Armaments will actually give you 250 rep with CE instead of the normal 75. That quest is linked here:\

The same thing happened to us, went thru the entire dungeon, only 1 wipe.  Got to Murmur, the key seeker (the guy we came there with that needed the key) died trying to kill the 70 elite.  He ran back and made it in time for the party to kill the 70 elite guarding the First Key  Fragment.  Another party member wanted us to \"Wait\" to loot so he could get his friend since she needed the key as well.  I even whispered to the guy to go ahead and loot it.  He didn't loot it and after about 5 minutes or so, it disappeared.  We still got rep and killed monsters, the party as a whole was very successful so we'll try again another day.

\
Morug:\
\
Has a \"Poison Splash\" Aoe that hits for 900ish with a 200+ dot over 10 seconds. The range seems to be about 15 yards. Casts about once every 30 seconds. \
\
Has a throw ability where he hurls his saw blade at you. Around a 30 yard range and hits for 900-1100 on 20% damage reduction.\
\
Average melee from 500-800.\
\
Definitely the harder of the two for this quest, but it can be soloed with proper use of cooldowns and some patience. Has about 29k hp ( according to mobhp )\
\
Make sure to clear a suitable area to fight just before you pull. Respawns will wipe you.\
\
You will want to keep crippling poison up for this fight.\
\
Start off with a CS > Shiv > Rupture then run  towards your cleared kill zone. Make sure to keep him in combat with deadly throw / ranged weapons. You will probably be hit with his saw blade attack, don't worry. \
\
As soon as he reachs your kill spot, Immediately hit evasion and reach 5 combo points. Keep doing white dps while saving your cp until evasion wears. Gouge into a kidney shot ( gouge is to prevent an unlucky parry / dodge / block ) Dps him during the ks and move backwards just before it wears off, hopefully he will be slowed and you can stay safely out of his melee range until your gouge cooldown comes back up.\
\
Use your blind early, and CoS out of his poison dot every time it is up. \
\
The fight should consist of brief periods of melee to gain combo points, followed by a gouge > kite > gouge > ks > melee > gouge repeat.\
\
You do NOT want to stay at range for a long period of time, long enough for you gouge cooldown to finish. Staying at range for too long will result in not having enough hp to finish the fight. Do not give him an extended window in which to poison you / saw attack. You should have a max of 6 seconds of kiting to preform before you run in to gouge unless a special misses.\
\
Use all your cooldowns early. This includes bandages and potions. They will probably refresh before you kill him.\
\
If your gouge / ks don't connect for some reason, just shiv him with cripple and kite some more. You have about 5-6 minutes to play with him before respawns of the spot you cleared return, so don't feel you have to rush the fight.\
\
Silroth:\
\
Has a \"chemical flames\" attack. Not as issue at all, just run out of it.\
\
Has another flame based attack, I didn't catch the name because it was so easy to interrupt. Takes about 3 seconds to cast. Just kick / gouge / whatever to get him to stop.\
\
Average melee on leather for 400-700\
\
If you soloed Morug first, this guy is a cakewalk.\
\
Similar strat to Morug . Clear an area to work in. This is the only part harder than Morug in some respects. There are many many more patrols by Silroth. I cleared a path west up upon a hill to where I could see the ecodome and fought him there.\
\
I used mind numbing poison main hand and cripple off hand for this fight.\
\
CS > Shiv > Rupture > Run to cleared area.\
\
Evasion tank it up till 5 CP then Gouge > Ks > Melee > Gouge etc. \
\
I could tank his damage much more easily than Morug's. With a liberal use of kick and a blind / bandage thrown in I didn't have to kite him much at all.\
\
He has about 10k hp less than Morug ( According to mobhp ) and seems to have less damage reduction.\
\
It may take you a few tries to get the hang of it, but this quest is definitely soloable by a decently geared rogue who knows how to handle the fight.",

The poison attack can be avoided pretty easily, but the saw blade attack is spammed far too often both to outlast him and to brute-force him in zerker stance. I tried kiting him to the Stormspire, but I could not both damage him enough to get loot and get him to Stormspire without dying. Since you need to be within 30 yds to shoot him every few seconds you will eat a lot of saw blades on the way there. Even if I didn't eat any poison splashes he would have me down at 4-5k hp by the time I got to the Stormspire, and then you need to get him down to 50% (iirc for loot) before you can drag him to the guards. Get a group-mate for this one. \

\
Ok..  a little preface. Gradav is in the back of the next cubby hole past wravien.  The problem is that you have to cut a wide path around the mana feeders next to wravien so they wont agro.  there are four protectors that you will have to time and watch.  a safe place to watch is after you jump down off the ledge and pass the mana feeders, wravien is right in front of you.  the first cubby hole is to the right.  jump up on the little ledge (cubby hole, right side) and watch em from around the middle bookshelf you can walk behind on the ledge.\
\
i noticed 2 protectors guarding this area.  after they walk away, after a slight pause, the protectors guarding the 2nd cubby hole will walk out of the way..  (briefly)!  this is your chance to slip past wravien and his mana feeders, turn right into the 2nd cubby hole and get to the back behind gradav and his altar.  the arcane protector that pats to gradav wont agro if you're stealthed behind the altar.  take a little breather, you've just completed the toughest part!\

\
Getting into the hut was not too tuff, Invis Pot + Nifty Stop Watch worked. I was able to get to him and free him from his ball in chain, but after he is free'd he walks down into the middle of the hut surrounded by mobs.\
\
I was able to kite them up the stairs and then jump down and turn in the quest, but I got 1 shot before able to accept the next.\
\
The Handlers have true-sight, so if anyone does try this, make sure to go well around them.\

p.s. I'ma a priest, would probably be pretty easy for a rogue.",

Nice little trick, just be real quick about getting back so she doesn't get killed, though as was said, she can take a good beating.\

\
Yet another pop culture reference by the good folks at Bliz. \
In the 1986 movie Stand By Me there is a scene involving a town pie eating contest. The fat kid who everyone picked on named Gordie (Lardass) stages a prank and before the pie eating begins he eats raw eggs and chugs down a bottle of castor oil.  After gorging himself with blueberry pie he projectile vomits starting a chain reaction of purple vomit amongst the other contestants eventually the whole crowd erupts in puking.\
\
It goes like this:\
\
Slowly a sound started to build in Lardass' stomach. A strange and scary sound like a log-truck coming at you at a hundred miles an hour. Suddenly, Lardass opened his mouth. And before Bill Travis knew it he was covered with five pies worth of used blueberries. The women in the audience screamed. Bossman Bob Cormier take one look at Bill Travis and barfed on Principal Wiggins. Principal Wiggins barfed on the lumberjack that was sitting next to him. Mayor Grundy barfed on his wife's tits. But when the smell hit the crowd, that's when Lardass' plan really started to work. Girlfriends barfed on boyfriends. Kids barfed on their parents. A fat lady barfed in her purse. The Donelley twins barfed on each other. And the women's auxiliary barfed all over the benevolent order of antelopes. And Lardass just sat back and enjoyed what he created. A complete and total barf-o-rama.",

Quest Notes: Quest giver wants 10 of these cubes saturated around Manaforge Coruu. They are a pink box, that look like an energy ball inside the center of it.  Right click on it, and pick it up.  \
\
There IS a recent problem with the size of the loot window â meaning when you try to click on the box, it wonât show you a gear to loot.  Iâm lazy and donât like to look all over for that tiny spot, what I did, was I scrolled my window out using my mouse roller, so the camera zoomed in/out... now WHILE the window is slowly zooming out (as in still moving to the camera setting you scrolled to, try to loot the box.  It works best only while the camera is moving in/out and youâre clicking on the box.  Thereâs always the little spot on the box to click on.  GL\
There are Sunfury BEâs all over the area, be sure to kill them for their sunfury signets, and experience!\

The Herod you see in CoT is level 16, quite an odd level to just pick out of the 1-70ish levels you can choose from. Herod in Scarlet Monastery Armory is level 40, so there isn't much correlation between the numbers 16 and 40.\

So, assuming level 16 Herod in CoT was a random picked level, then we can guess he's anywhere between 5-15ish, given the model that he's using.\
\
But, I believe level 16 was given to depict his age in some form. Considerably since you wouldn't be able to create a good teenager vs. kid model, they simply use kid and adult, so to distinguish Herod's age they use level, lacking the model to show it.",

Anyway, here is what we had when it worked:\
\
First boss was the imp who threw 3k fireballs every once in awhile. Quite easy especially with the break for Millhouse to spawn.\
\
Second boss was the air elemental who did the AOE lightning that hit for quite alot, probably ~4k I would say every 10-15 seconds. It's not bad with some aoe heals but you have to watch out the a curse he does which is 100% more damage.\

    "10397205791102057912007/12/22 22:34:00hhallahhThis is easily one of the hardest non-group quests in the game, imo, for several reasons:\
\
1) Extraordinarily high mob density leading towards the named mob. Trying to run past anything is pretty much suicide since there are few places that are clear enough to lose aggro in.\
\
2) Very fast repop rate. 5 minutes at most for the normal mobs, no more than 2 on the named mob. Don't get caught off guard here, if you die or stall in your clear you'll probably have to start over. I remember one time I did this on my Warlock and I approached from the south (cliff) side and got stuck in a continuous battle where mobs repopped as fast as I could kill them until I died.\
\
3) Lots of patrols, and annoying ones at that. Rather than simply respawning, a lot of the mobs will spawn in the portal in the base and move back to their normal spot or route. This means that there's a fair chance that mobs will get in your way as you try to shut off the portal even if you've cleared the entire area.\
\
4) A couple trash mobs path over to the named mob... and then stay on top of him for quite a while. Either you have to wait it out (a minute or more) or fight two or more mobs at once... assuming they don't evade bug, which they can. Seriously, whose idea was it to make patrols that stand on top of the named mob for a long time, and then move? Either make them tied or don't, don't make people wait forever when there's a short respawn timer as is.\
\
5) There are several mobs around the portal that will path by it and aggro onto you while you try to shut it off. Also, shutting it off can be difficult because even if you know that you have to click and where you have to click, you need to be at the right camera angle in order to click and not have the game think you're trying to click on something on the other side of the portal. Very annoying.",

This should give you enough time to do a majority of the damage on the wraith while the ogres help finish him off.  \

If all goes well, you can loot it!  You only need to get the majority of damage on one wraith to complete the quest.  Good luck!",

Tip: Jump down on the little platform on the hill south of where the Drillmaster patrols. Pull him and always keep facing down the hill. That way he will only knock you up the hill and you won't take any fall damage or pull other mobs.\

He's actually very easy, if done right. Provided you know where he is, you should know that you can actually jump into the small, secluded place where he is, by jumping from the cliff a bit left of the bridge to the ramparts instances. \
When you look down there, you can see that there's another piece of 'cliff' from which you can actually attack him with ranged.\
\
What I did was jump down there, summon imp, and wait for him to patrol between the bigger tent in the middle and the smaller tent on the right, and then put an instant dot on him to aggro him when he was perfectly distanced from both mobs, so I didn't pull adds.\
When he comes to you, simply fear him and dot him up, do your thing etc, and use the imp for mana. I believe he has around 15k hp, which was about 3-4 \"full dots\" for me, with 236 spell dmg. Don't worry, he doesn't run down and get adds  - He just runs around on the piece of cliff you're standing on.",

    "109391127991701127992007/06/29 10:10:03phinarEvaluating this trinket as if it were equivalent to a straight +crit trinket overlooks a lot of its real value. What this trinket excels at is making worst-case performance substantially better, not making average-case performance substantially better. For average-case performance, it still offers impressive gains to characters with low crit.\
\
For characters who have buffs that proc on crit -- Flurry, Unleashed Rage, Vengeance -- a long string of no crits can seriously harm your damage output, because you're waiting for that crit to amplify everything else. If you have a 25% crit rate, a streak of 8 attacks without a crit is about 10% likely, whereas with this card, it's only about 7% likely. That's about 1 in 30 fights where Flurry/Unleashed Rage/Vengeance is up consistently where it wouldn't be without. The average crit chance gain is only .6%, but the likelihood of very bad scenarios is significantly reduced.\
\
For characters who don't get AP from agility -- warriors and shamans, basically -- this trinket also offers a way to get a dramatic boost in crit rating without having to load on agility at the expense of attack power, strength, and stamina. You can re-select your itemization to account for the fact that this trinket will boost your crit and minimize your worst-case scenarios.\
\
Equating this trinket with its average case conversion to critical strike rating does not really account for the power of its stacking-buff model.",

\
The drawback is that you already do heavy threat without the crits.",
    "10939155920211127992007/09/20 23:32:59SidonisI personally think this is a must have for Survival Hunters. The benefits of heading towards non-stop crit is just too much.\
\
1) More procs of Expose Weakness, thereby more often increasing the physical damage of the raid\
\
2) More 40% mana refunds on shots that crit.\
\
Coupling this trinket with 5/5 Master Tactician (6% chance for all ranged attacks to increase crit by 10% for 8 sec), and you can easily skyrocket your sustained dps (mana refund) and utility to the raid (expose weakness)",

A list by Greengoo\

1. Kindness\
- Kill 8 Rocknail Flayers, Use Carcasses to Feed 8 Dragons (don't move!). Also make sure to travel a bit when laying the meat, as the same drakes won't eat twice in a row.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10804\
\
2. Seek Out Neltharaku\
- Fly on your mount and find Neltharaku, he patrols slowly around Dragonmaw about a few hundred feet up. You'll have to be about 5 yards UNDER him to talk to him.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10811\
\
3. Neltharaku's Tale\
- Listen to story.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10814\
\
4. Infiltrating Dragonmaw Fortress\
- Kill 15 of any type of orcs in the fortress.\

\
5.To Netherwing Ledge!\
- Find 12 Crystals from the floating island SE of the mainland.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10837\
\
6. The Force of Neltharaku\
- Free 5 Dragons by using the item on them, then killing the orcs they agro.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10854\
\
7. Karynaku\
- Find Karynaku, she's the second story of the fortress.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10858\
\
8. Zuluhed the Whacked\
- Kill Zuluhed and recover the key. I recommend pulling him inside so as to avoid the archers, and kill him BEFORE he summons his add. Use the key he drops to free Karynaku.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10872\
\
9. Ally of the Netherwing\
- Return to Mordenai, you will immediately gain 42,000 rep and become neutral.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10870\
\
10. ????\
- Blizzard has announced that next patch they will be introducing a continuence of this quest line, including the ability to get exalted and purchase or receive through extensive questing an EPIC netherdrake mount. You will need epic training to use it however, so save your gold!",

Like any other quest, when you complete an objective, the yellow colored text stating that completed objective will show on your screen.

If you are impatient and go through the camp to kill mobs, watch out for the Fel Canon MK1 (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22461#00Rzc) on the southern and western edges of the camp - they blend in with the other background stuff and  were firing on me before I knew it. They're not worth taking out either since they only drop junk worth a few silver. You fight these in the next part of the quest chain so why bother now?",

\
Once, he aggroed on me when I was fighting one of the little guys. I had just killed him, so wasn't expecting it. Killed Razorsaw again right as another add aggroed on me. Before that add was halfway dead, Razorsaw respawned right where I was standing and I had to run for it. \
\
He patrols the whole camp, so watch out! He can sneak up behind you really easily.",

I hadn't cleared out any mobs ahead of time, and while the NPC walks in her path with no regard as to how many mobs she'll pull (especially the casters), Warlocks have a VERY easy time here.  You can easily deal with her pulling 3 or 4 (which happens often).  Make the Voidwalker pick up the melee, and you pick up the casters.  They primarily cast shadowbolt so just slap on Curse of Tounges and pop Shadow Ward and they're cake.  Then finish off any remaining melee mobs.\
\
As with any escort quest, don't engage a mob unless she does - you don't want her ignoring something you thought she'd pull, then have her go on ahead!\
\
As some have mentioned, there are no \"scripted\" pulls or events that take place, no additional mobs will spawn, you fight what you pull in the process of walking her out.  Once you get past the far gate (down the road slightly from the main gate at Firewing Point) the quest will complete and she will shift into travel form and run off.\
\
I did not find this quest difficult in the slightest, but I believe that is in large part because of the combination between Warlock class abilities and the abilities (such as casters favoring shadow bolt) of these particular mobs.",

    "109115199850519982007/03/16 06:33:23ElerisA few druid tips:\
You can buff the canon with MotW. You can heal it using rejuvenation and lifebloom. Regrowth doesn't work. I haven't tried healing touch but it likely doesn't work either.\
Healing the canon will make the imps aggro you, so it might be useful if you get behind with killing the imps as an easy way to divert them from the canon.\
\
Feral druid tips:\
Stay in bear form, in your tanking gear. Try to move backwards as you kill the imps so you avoid the explosion damage.\
Use swipe to kill the imps, it's enough to one shoot them. And you should be full rage all the time while doing this.\
Auto attack doesn't cut it, it's too slow and if it misses you'll get an imp exploding on the canon.\
\
You'll still have nothing better than the auto attack to kill the imps with while you use frenzied regeneration however, but you can use faerie fire feral to aggro the imps that you miss to alleviate the problem a bit.\
\
If a dog show up, just tank it, dps it down and keep it in front of the canon, and when the canon attack cooldown is up, use the flame thrower attack to insta kill it.\
If it fails somehow, just finish off the dog yourself. Use swipe and demo roar while fighting the dog to grab some of the imps as well.",

    "10911164597201645972007/10/08 03:59:54DeeBeeTo summarize:\
\
After converting the cannon, nothing happens until after your first cannonball attack on the portal.\
The cannonball & AoE flamethrower share a 15 second cooldown.\
The first cannonball attack causes imps to spawn non-stop from the portal -- about one every 2-3 secs.\
The imps explode in a short-range AoE to attack and head straight at the cannon.\
The imps have 450hp, according to http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22474\
If you one-shot kill them, they don't explode, they just die.\
If you hit and don't kill them, or generate threat in any way, they turn and explode on you instead of the cannon.\
\
You need to have a pet bar available and visible to do this quest. If you have addons that hide it, disable them. If you already have a pet, you'll have to dismiss it.\
\
If you convert the cannon without clearing the area first, the mobs will attack the cannon if they wander within standard aggro range. I had a wandering dog eat my north cannon from behind, since I was paying more attention to stemming the tide of a'splodin imps.\
\
Dogs (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22500) can / do spawn in at random intervals instead of imps. For me, southern portal spawned none, while the north one spawned two in succession halfway through the cannon blasts.\
\
Some claim that side-stepping, or stepping away from the imp as you hit it may help dodge their exploding damage. YMMV.\
\
If the cannon dies, just wait. It will respawn. Be aware that by this time, previously cleared mobs may be respawning as well.\
\
For shamans - totems are immune to AoE. Use that knowledge as creatively as you want.\
\
Everyone else - you need to figure out a class-specific way of mitigating the damage (heal, bubble, mana shield, plain old soak) or perform many one-shot kills (backstab, earthshock, fire blast, etc). Ideally, you'll have to find a middle-ground of damage soaking, and popping imps, leaving yourself some buffer health / mana / rage / energy to deal with the occasional dog.\
\
Good luck, and have fun.",

They have less than 400 hp each.\
\
On the Northern Cannon there seems to be a Bug, sometimes Imp's don't get damage. But that's no big deal.\
\
For the Summoned Wrath Hound some people here mentioned for the Southern Gate, that's just a normal patrolling mob, kill it and you only have to deal with imps, nothing else.\
\
The Imps only explode for 500 damage if they come in melee range. If you either one-shot them or keep them at range you have no need for bandages/hp gear",

    "10911189471101894712007/11/22 12:38:12NefarionI'm doing this as a 60 warlock (in 2.3) and it's horrible.\
\
It's an easy start. Clear the mobs around the cannon and activate it using the item. Not hard. (Note though it takes away your pet!) Once you fire your first shot (on the pet bar), Imps will come in constant waves. They don't hit very hard and have VERY low health (Searing Pain can one-shot them), but they'll kill the cannon if they gather on it.. At the northern cannon after a couple shots I had dog-like creatures begin to spawn along with the Imps, at an increasing rate. They're quite a bit harder and will require a little more firing focus. Note that if you get swamped the cannon also has an AoE ability to fight these things.\
\
If you're an affliction warlock like me, be careful. Dependent upon my Imp for mana, I was surprised to see that Blizzard de-spawns your pet when you take control of the cannon. Though I had no issues with the southern cannon, this proved a problem for the northern cannon. Out of the 5 times I attempted it I got an add (the huge orange dog) 4 times, and having resorted to Life Tapping for mana (even with bandages and a healthstone) I found that (having spammed Searing Pain) by the time he came I had too little health and mana to take care of just him, let alone the waves of Imps and doggies still crashing into my cannon.\
\
I eventually just gave up. I'll re-visit the quest at a later time when I'm stronger.",

\
7. Karynaku\
- Find Karynaku, she's the second story of the fortress.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10858\
\
8. Zuluhed the Whacked\
- Kill Zuluhed and recover the key. I recommend pulling him inside so as to avoid the archers, and kill him BEFORE he summons his add. Use the key he drops to free Karynaku.\

\
9. Ally of the Netherwing\
- Return to Mordenai, you will immediately gain 42,000 rep and become neutral.\

\
10. ????\
- Blizzard has announced that next patch they will be introducing a continuence of this quest line, including the ability to get exalted and purchase or receive through extensive questing an EPIC netherdrake mount. You will need epic training to use it however, so save your gold!",

as long as they still have the key from killing Zuluhed, just bring them with you, let them use the key on karynaku after you have taken the original quest to release her, then just quickly turn in the quest once it is completed and done, took me about 30 seconds once i got to the ledge (gotta love the help of friends)",

I agree with the above that it's not necessary to kill the skulls, but hey a few Arcane Explosions never go astray - particularly as you'll drop out of combat during the event and can drink up. Keep an eye on the Anchorite - while I threw out the occasional Arc Exp on the skulls, his health didn't drop that much but as a player I know that sometimes too much healing can never be enough ;)\
\
Cooldown on the Prayer Beads is 15 seconds.\
\
When the vomiting of the green ooze occurred, I popped a Drangonling (think it was just the Mithril). It happily helped out with killing off the oozes, along once again with Arc Ex. Each time I dropped out of combat to drink, I'd hit the prayer beads to heal the Anchorite.\

This step sounds tough, but I've now done it on a hunter and a mage now and I believe it's a heck of a lot easier than what it sounds.",

First get naked as you will have to die once.  Place a SS on yourself and wait for the pat to move past the 2 guards. Start running.  Just as you get to the arch in the hallway use your first invis potion.  Run into the room with Pandemonius and just behind and to the right there is a raised area. The goal is to get on top of that and as far to the back end as possible of it.  Unfortunately your invis will run out just before you reach the bottom of the raised area.  I have instant cast howl of terror so just as i reached the foot of it i used that to give me the second or 2 to reach the top before they killed me.  I rezed via the SS and waited 10 minutes for another invis potion.  \

Once invis was back i used my stopwatch to increase my speed, started running and used my second invis pot.  The invis pot ran out just as i was entering the caved in doorway just behind the chamber.  \

He passes though a few clefthoofs and then 2 wind elemental spawns, makes a turn a few degrees and starts heading east around there. It has always been clear of additional mobs, so thats where I've squatted to tank him in the 5 or 6 times I've PUG'd it.",
    "99383817560381752007/02/18 13:56:33FabricatedDurn is huge and wanders in a circular pattern around the Spirit Fields, you can't really miss him.\
\
I think that at level 66-67 you could 3-4 man this without too much trouble. I 5-manned this with guildies, a feral druid, a prot-spec war (me), a warlock, a hunter, and a holy-spec pally main healing.\
\
I recommend finding Durn and clearing a small area to fight in. He hit me (425 Defense, 10500 or so Armor) for about 1100-1200 per whack. He has a knockback (800ish damage I want to say) but it's pretty short so you don't really need to tank him against a mountain or clear a square mile of territory to fight him in.\
\
Short Version:\
1. Find Durn.\
2. Quickly clear a small area to fight him in.\
3. Pull.\
4. Tank and Spank. (~1100-1600 non-crushing damage depending on armor/def, 800-1000 maybe on knockback)",

It took me a while to find the Champion so I could get the banner. That was actually the hardest part, since I never bothered to look up his location :)\

When I had the banner, it was pretty straightforward. Ride down to the area with the tower, down in the south. Kill about 4 mobs to get to the tower. Run up to the top, while killing one mob on the way up and 1 at the top. Planted the banner and waited for the first 2 mobs. When they came I set an explosive trap, had my pet charge one ogre, whilst i took care of the other one.\
Refilled my health and mana, while waiting for the 2nd wave.\
Same thing now, pet on one Ogre, explosive trap. Now i however also used \"The Beast Within\", sending my pet and me into a frenzy.\
Another refill of health and mana, followed by the same thing, but with 4 Ogres. A bit harder but never went beneath 1/4 HP.\
Last refill of health and mana.\
Took out the last guy, pretty easy.\

\
I was able to solo this as a level 67 combat swords rogue.  Easier than I expected, didn't have to use a health pot.\
\
Tips:\
For the first wave just dps both down, no cooldowns needed.\
\
For 2nd wave, make sure you are stealthed at the top of the tower (after either bandaging or eating until full health).  The three mobs will make their way up from the bottom.  Make sure you target the geomancer and mash your opener as it arrives at the top.  There will be a period where the mobs are unable to be attacked, but if you keep hitting your opener (I recommend cheap shot) you will get it off before they hit you.  For this wave use Blade fury and cloak of shadows to stop some damage from the caster.  Should be a fairly simple affair\
\
3rd wave: Same as 2nd in that you need to make sure you get your opener off before they hit you.  Target any mob as they all are melee classes and do roughly the same damage.  Once you get your opener off and have slice and dice active use evasion + adrenaline rush to burn them down.\
\
Final wave: Simple make sure you have full health and burn him :) One thing to remember is that he enrages so make sure you have some combo points for a kidney shot.  His enrage should wear about the same time as your stun.  When he is not enraged he dosent hit that hard so you will kill him before he kills you.\
\
Hope that helps.",

\
You'll face several waves of ogre baddies, starting with just two.  The waves spawn at the foot of the tower, run all the way to the top, and then turn aggressive towards you.  You can get to about midtower and drink without them aggroing if you run through them as they go up.\
\
The mobs themselves are pretty standard orcs, no elites.  As a mage, I polymorphed one mob, and then used the circular ramp to frostnova and kite the remaining ones until they're dead.  Then, I can kill the last poly no problem.\
\
There are four waves.  I'm not sure if the waves are the same each time.  These are the waves I got.\

\
One thing of note is the section of hills you slow-fall from is covered with trees, messing up your line of site. (This may be more important to cows and cthulus.) If you zoom in until you're in the fist person you will be able to see the eggs and line yourself up much easier. Once I zoomed in I hit the eggs first shot.\

Note: maybe it was because the person I was with sort of cheated and used his flying mount, but I did not get credit for cracking the eggs when he did it. Be careful of this.",

Using the Jump-a-tron gives you a 3 minute duration slow fall debuff, and the only practical way to land in the nest is to click it off once you're at the proper trajectory floating above it.\

Once you interact with and take the egg, the matriarch will swoop down and is non-aggressive, ready to be killed.  I completed this quest with another warrior, and it was moderately difficult, though using taunt and bandaging properly made it reasonable to do.",

Easy solo as a 35/0/21 level 65 warlock.  Just fear and DoT it.  Takes a while.  Recommend using Curse of Doom, as it has better DPS than Agony, just make sure when it ticks that you're ready to reapply fear, because it will break fear.",

\
However, I switched over to having my pet wail on her while I healed him (I am BM spec, so that probably helped).  My pet was an owl, which have low natural armor so it should be easier for a more well-rounded/tanking style pet.  When my mana ran low, I frost trapped her and feign-drunk some water.  It took a while and my pet died a few times, but it worked more efficiently than kiting for me, at least.",
    "101116327321558802007/04/07 09:47:24JaylenIt is the speed of the Epic mount, +100%.  It works along the lines the faster you are going when you jump the farther you go.  I once saw a speed hacked character jump horizontal long enough to take falling damage.\
\
The +100% it is possible to jump from that cliff above and void the trampoline entirely.  This reduces the odds of dying in a failed attempt.  Thus reducing the gold used on repair.  It also removes the element of skill in timing the fall.\
\
This is barely doable at epic mount speed.  Other mount speed boosters make it easier.  Thus it is impossible to do this with a normal mount.  The thing is, you do need to have that trampoline buff on.",

Second try on the trampoline and I reached the eggs. \

Simply stood on the front edge of it and clicked, quickly removed the slowing buff and shapeshifted into cat form just in case.\

Started with Regrowth, Rejuvenation and Lifebloom - Dire Bear Form.\
Attacked till I had like 50% hp, then stun, hibernate and healed up. Repeated this a couple of times until my mana was gone and innervate was used. At that time I just hibernated and waited for around 1k mana then rejuvenation and lifebloom and kept doing the same thing. War stomp is a plus too :)",

\
Get the slow-fall buff from the trampoline. Then mount up (epic mount only) and go up on the ridge a few yards south-east of the tree. If you time your jump good you should be able to float into the nest. It is doable without any speed spell on your mount, but it's piece of cake with stuff like \"Carrot on a stick\" or the \"Animal handler\" talent of the hunter.\

I jumped into the tree from the cliff in front of it with the slow-fall buff.  After that I cracked the egg and waited for the bird to spawn.\

Like others have said, stand dead center of the trampoline; make sure that when your on it you're looking straight from the top view down so that you know when to right click on the slow fall buff (when you're over the nest release the buff); if your a lock soulstone yourself in case you die when you land in the nest. Res and click on the egg. When the elite bird appears, send the void out to attack; drain life and pds. When void gets close to the end of his life, sacrifice him and continue dps and fear the bird until he dies. Insure you have a healthstone and some cloth bandages to hold you over. I did it at level 67 on my destrution lock.",

Since this bird hits so hard your pet can't tank him for very long, so take off growl.\
\
Run up and use \"Scare Beast\", dps him while feared then lay down a \"Freezing Trap\" and drag him over it when the fear expires.  This should give the cooldown on your \"Scare Beast\" more than enough time to expire, before the trap breaks use your fear again.  Rinse and repeat, no kiting needed.",

On my pally (65 at the time) I used a 1h mace and shield and gave myself BoW. I then cast JoW on the spider and cast SoR... then I began tickling away... \
My mana never got below 50% despite the fact I kept healing myself whenever I saw the need to (usually switching from Dev Aura to Conc aura to get uninterrupted heals and then back again once the heals went off) and I was constantly judging righteousness, throwing rank 2 consecrate and holy shock whenever possible (and obviously cleansing the damn poison). Took a solid two or three minutes but I did not blow any pots or bubble, just a few stuns here and there.\
\
Much easier on my lock (66 at the time)... Used fel armor, the demo buffs, Bluefin food buff, and wizard oil. Blessing of Auchindoun was down since the other faction was controlling the towers.\
Started off with Amplify Curse and threw CoD on the spider along with corruption and Immo as my Felguard began hacking away. I managed to throw in a shadowbolt before the Felguard's health fell below 50% then I just kept him alive and refreshed the DoTs when needed.

Its very hard to avoid damaging it when the mob runs and pops his enrage shield. So I suggest to start a heal as soon as it does this. You will need at least 1 mana pot (I used pvp mana pot). I have about 750 damage, 10k health, 8k mana, and 24% to crit. I died a few times figuring out what the trick to arvoar is, but the den mother took 1 try (since it is exactly the same).

Keep Demoralizing Roar up on him and spam Maul + Mangle. It'll take a few minutes but you should kill him without having to heal.

I suggest to \"pre-pull\" the 2 guards right outside the tomb entrance to prevent the NPC to move slightly on left to attack them because he will then agro the caster on the other side of the \"wall\" which will bring 2 extra mobs.\

1. Clear immediate area around questgiver.  Get quest.\

5. Akuno will run to one or two more mobs nearby--there is a very short time between these fights.\

\
The horsemen are very fast so they practically appear out of nowhere for you, so there's no way to anticipate them and kill them in advance.  Their patrol path is short so the chances are not even small that they will get in your way just as you leave the tomb with the escort in tow.\
\
I had to attempt this three times with my well-geared BM hunter, and I even had Misdirection ready to grab aggro as fast as possible (to no avail because the NPC will lightning zap all four of the mobs that are on him and then there's hardly a way to get them off him before he dies).\

I succeeded when I didn't get the horse patrol, and in that case the quest was, in fact, easy.\

Really straight forward; cat form for the single/dual pulls and bear for the one time he managed to pull 3-5 mobs. As Wildhorn mentioned, Akuno's Chain Lightning does [b]insane[/b] damage - 40-45% of the mobs HP and I've seen it jump twice (damaging three mobs in all). So while I was in bear form tanking, he basically killed the mobs for me.

You can't let him tank one as he dies within ~15 seconds of doing so, so tank and kill both as best you're able. If you clear from him to outside and run back, you can just get him to skip the first spawn.\
\
Mobs you need to clear:\
2 - Interrogator next to him and the mob closest to the Interrogator (pull it carefully so you don't get its neighbour)\
2 - the mobs in the next (second) room (one patrolling, one next to the doorway)\
1 - the mob in the third room\
2 - outside, the mobs on either side of the entrance\
\
This is as far as I could clear and still have time to get back to him and get him to walk and not snag the newly-spawned. Then, walking with him, you fight:\
\
0-2 mobs in the first room, depending on whether you get back fast enough\
2-4 mobs in the third room, depending on whether he aggroes the ones on the sides (two spawn here)\
2-5 outside - two more spawn here and there are 3 patrollers in the area as well. How many you fight depends on their pathing.\

\
The Black Temple attunement starts at The Altar of the Sha'tar for Aldors, and the Sanctum of the Sun for Scryers. Both are in Shadowmoon Valley.\
\
Aldors start attunement from Anchorite Ceyla (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21402) at the Altar of Sha'tar in Shadowmoon Valley:\
1. [A] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10568 [70] Tablets of Baa'ri\
2. [A] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10571 [70] Oronu the Elder\

4. [A] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10575 [70] The Warden's Cage\
\
Scyers start attunement from Arcanist Thelis (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21955) at the Sanctum of Stars:\
1. [Sc] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10683 [70] Tablets of Baa'ri\
2. [Sc] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10684 [70] Oronu the Elder\
3. [Sc] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10685 [70] The Ashtongue Corruptors\
4. [Sc] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10686 [70] The Warden's Cage\
\
After that, the chain comes together for Aldor and Scryer.\
\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10622 [70] Proof of Allegiance\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10628 [70] Akama\
7. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10705 [70] Seer Udalo\
\
Seer Udalo is found in the Arcatraz (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3846) just before the last boss.\
\
8. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10706 [70] A Mysterious Portent\
9. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10707 [70] The Ata'mal Terrace\
10. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10708 [70] Akama's Promise\
\
After you finish this chain, you get to pick from some rewards and the chain seems like it ends. It continues however, inside Serpentshrine Cavern (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3607) from an NPC called Seer Olum (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22820) who you can speak with after killing Fathom-Lord Karathress. He starts the next part of the Black Temple Chain by offering the quest:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10944 [70] The Secret Compromised\
For this quest you just return to Akama.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10946 [70] Ruse of the Ashtongue\
In this quest, you must use the costume Akama provides, and kill A'lar in Tempest Keep: The Eye while wearing the Ashtongue Cowl. Attunement for The Eye is a whole different chain.\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10947 [70] An Artifact From the Past\
In this, you need to gain access to The Battle of Mount Hyjal in Caverns of Time, and slay the first boss, Rage Winterchill. Attunement for this involves killing Lady Vashj and Kael'Thas Sunstrider.\
4. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10948 [70] The Hostage Soul\
For this you must speak with A'dal in Shattrath city.\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10949 [70] Entry into the Black Temple\
For this, just speak with the naaru Xi'ri in front of Black Temple.\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10985 [70] A Distraction for Akama\
Unknown what this quest asks of you, most likely you need to defend Xi'ri and make your way into Black Temple. At the end, you become attuned to enter and are granted The Medallion of Karabor (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32649)\
\
At this point, you are attuned and can enter Black Temple, although the chain continues and you can soon upgrade your medallion. It continues with:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10958 [70] Seek Out the Ashtongue\
You just need to find Seer Kanai (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=23158) inside Black Temple.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10957 [70] Redemption of the Ashtongue\
This involves entering Black Temple, and killing the boss the Shade of Akama (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22841).\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10959 [70] The Fall of the Betrayer\
After killing the Shade of Akama and returning to Seer Kanai, he asks one last thing of you. Kill Illidan The Betrayer. After doing so, you are granted the Blessed Medallion of Karabor, an upgraded version of your original medallion, and allows teleportation to the Black Temple.",

6. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10628][70] Akama[/url]\
7. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10705][70] Seer Udalo (Dungeon)[/url]\
\
Here, you have to venture into the [b]Arcatraz[/b] (which requires a Rogue with 350 lockpicking or somebody to open the door who's completed the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10262]Arcatraz Key chain[/url], which requires trips to the Mechanar and the Botanica respectively) to the room just before the final boss.  Sadly it's (nearly) impossible to stealth to.  Finding Udalo leads to:\
\
Talk to Akama:\
8. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10706][70] A Mysterious Portent[/url]\
Kill waves of nonelites, 3 elites and a boss (5-man) on a terrace outside the Black Temple:\
9. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10707][70] The Ata'mal Terrace[/url]\
Finally, deliver the medallion to A'dal in Shattrath City:\

1- unequip all your durability items though, you will still probably die several times.\

2- you can get into shadow lab without the key, by dying outside the gate and ressing inside. (fly up, and drop worked for me)\

3- if you harvest 1 soul device and reset each time, you'll not be able to go into another instance for 1 hour afterwards (You have entered too many instances recently!)\

So hereby I can confirm that as of now (24 May, 2007) after patch 2.1.0 you still do not loose Netherwing reputation by killing these things. However I guess when your Netherwing reputation reaches Friendly you can no longer set the \"At war\" flag, thereby you will not be able to kill these dragons for this quest. So do it while you are at Neutral or less with the Netherwing.

The easy way to do this is to team up with someone that is not doing the Netherwing rep (or has only done it to neutral and can go at war with them), set loot to Free-For-All, and have them do all the killing. Make sure you're the one to initially loot the body and you'll be able to loot the quest item. The trick is that the Nether Dragon Essences only show up for you when you're the first to loot the body (this held true with the Nether Dragon-related quest at Toshley's Station as well). We found that if the other player loots the body but does not take the Essence, and then the Friendly+ player goes to loot it it will not appear. Just make sure you loot first and you'll be set. Obviously you can do this with normal group loot as well if you're both doing the quest, it might just take longer if the other player finishes before you do.\

Just soloed it as an affliction warlock. Siphon life+ curse of exhaustion and kite them around. I died 5 secs after the last wave spawned; I completed it, because I tagged a siphon life on all of them.",

I got the 30 second warning, but 30 seconds later nothing happened despite the fact that none of the engineers were fixing the forge.

However, the objective of the quest is not to kill all the mobs; rather it's to survive for the 2 minute shutdown period.  We completed the quest, then proceeded to wipe on the 12 mobs we were training around the room :)\
\
The event is similar to the other shutdown events, except harder.  Roughly every 15 seconds, either a pack of 3 Mo'arg Technicians (not sure about the name) or 1 Mo'arg Warp-Master will spawn.  Close to the end of the event, the elite mentioned in the previous comments will spawn.  Also, don't be surprised if Overseer Azarad repops on you, since he has a lightning fast respawn time (like all other quest npc's).\

The quest is difficult as 2 man, so 3 would be recommended for a high probability of success.",

\
In the middle of the town as you approach the tower, there is a short road off to the left (south).  Near the end of this side road, there are two buildings burnt down to their foundations.  One is on the right, and one is on the left.  If you look carefully, each foundation has a staircase leading down.  The stair on the right leads to the pond.  The stair on the left leads to the well.\
\
It is possible to solo this quest, but slow and painful.  The ghosts are all single pulls, with a few long patrols thrown in.   Each single pull is not too tough.  The problem is that they take a while too kill.  If you take too long, the respawns will catch up with you, and you'll be in trouble, and there's no chance of running away (unless you're a rogue, of course).  So, you have to keep killing and moving fast enough to stay ahead of the respawns.\
\
There's also no room to maneuver.  While you can solo-pull the mobs, the slightest screwup means that you'll get one or two more.\
\
There is one dangerous wraith mob that casts shadow bolts that hit for nearly 1000.  That hurts, so use silence and interruption effects on that one.\
\
Skip the mobs you don't have to kill.  Consider elixirs or other consumables to increase your DPS.  Be prepared to deal with adds.  Bring potions and bandages.  Bring good food and water so you can recover quickly after each fight.  Bandage yourself and your pets instead of healing or eating to save time and mana.\
\

\
He patrols with 2 healer pals.  Wait for him to path away and make sure all groups on both sides of the hall are cleared out.   Once you are ready to take on Gargolmar, CC both healers and then simply DPS him down and finish them up.  If you cannot get both healers out of the way, then deal with one or both of them first as they will keep him healed up.\
\
Gargolmar will randomly charge group members, so this is a good fight to have everybody stand relatively close together so your tank can easily pick up aggro again after a charge.\
\
Omor the Unscarred (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=17308)\
\
Omor has three surprises.  First, he curses group members with an effect that does insane damage to other group members within 15 yards.  Decursing helps with this, but it's easiest to just spread out and ignore this curse on your ranged classes and concentrate the decursing on the meleers who have no choice but to stand next to each other.\
\
Secondly, he spawns felhunter adds who will start spell locking your casters.  Put an offtank/rogue on the job of keeping these cleared away.\
\
Lastly, he'll knock your tank up in the air and then shoot shadowbolts at whoever is next on the threat list.  Tanks should be prepared to switch to fury stance and hit intercept (Droods and pallies, I don't know if you have an equiv to this) - if you can do that fast enough you'll immediately re-engage him without hitting the ground.\
\
Handle all of the above and this fight is a pretty easy win.\
\
Vazruden \"The Rider\" (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=17537)\
Nazan \"The Dragon\" (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=17536)\
\
This can be a really rough fight.  The event is in play as soon as you touch one of the two final mobs at the base of the ramp where you see the dragon flying around in the air.\
\
Initially, it's a simple two-mob pull.  Once the second mob drops, then it's game time with Vazruden who will hop down off his mount to engage the group.  We've found it helpful to kill the first of the two mobs and then keep the second one CC'd for a bit to make sure all casters get topped off and everybody is healthy, because after this you'll not get much of a break.\
\
There's two good ways to handle Vazruden and Nazan, depending on how much DPS your group is putting out.  If you are chewing stuff up without a problem, then just DPS the crap out of Vaz and drop him as the dragon lands (the dragon will always land before he's dead, but if you're killing him fast enough it works out to drop him as your tank runs to the dragon).\
\
On the other hand, if your group is of the protection/holy/etc spec and you're better at staying alive than you are at dishing out mad DPS, then try the other approach.  Have your tank keep Vaz busy and everybody in the group that has range should be firing at the dragon in the air.  He IS vulnerable to attack while flying around and a strong ranged group can easily get him down to the 25% health range before he lands.\
\
Whichever approach you use, make sure you're dancing to stay out of the fire spits.\
\
When engaging Nazan, we've found it effective to have everybody move down to the ringed area.  Have your tank back up a bit and everybody else in the group stays in the 1/2 circle behind the dragon.  When the dragon breathes fire, the tank just runs \"inside\" him, rendering his spray effectless.  Everybody else's job is to avoid the fire spits and finish Nazan off.\
\
A fire potion is helpful to avoid some damage and make the fight easier, but if you stay on your toes and follow the above tips it's not necessary for a win.\

    "9575182390201823902007/11/11 12:19:19FixitThinking of having your guild run your 59 twink through these last two Hellfire quests to get your gear? Not sure if the experience points will make you level to 60? Here's what I found.\
\
The main thing is: you can avoid getting XP in the instances either by standing outside the entrance while the rest of your party does the killing, or by being inside but a long distance from them. You need to get up close for the three boss fights in Ramparts but those are the only times you need to get XP from killing anything.\
\
If you target your party's main tank and see a mob in the target-of-target, you're too close: you will get experience when that mob dies. The safe distance is about 200 yards I think. This is only tricky in Ramparts when the first long corridor bends back on itself: you have to follow them around and stay on the opposite side of the circle (except when killing Gargolmar of course). My party was progressing at a moderate speed and I never saw any respawn.\
\
I was in a party with four level 70's. Three orc trash mobs in Ramparts bumped me about 280 XP each when I got too close (that's including the unavoidable rested bonus). And a single orc in the Blood Furnace bumped me 560 XP!\
\
With those few trash mob XP kills, and including the 620 XP for discovering Hellfire Basin (outside the Blood Furnace entrance), my total XP gain was 33,746. That's 12,600 for the first quest, a total of around 6,200 for the unavoidable three boss kills in Ramparts, 12,950 for the second quest, and the rest in accidental trash mob XP. As others have mentioned, you don't have to stick around for the final boss fight in Furnace, just step to the edge of the large circular chamber.\
\
So if you're more than 18,800 XP from levelling to 60, you can do the first quest, and if you're more than 31,750 XP, you can do both. But you probably want to add a 5,000-10,000 XP safety margin to that, just in case.\
\
In two days, of course, patch 2.3 goes live and I don't know how much that will increase XP gains for level 59 characters. So in 2.3, your mileage will vary.",

Apex hit me (with 11k armor (53% mitigation) in bear) for around 200 so it was very managable and could heal through it.\
\
He was not immune to Bash nor Cyclone. I did not try roots as I only needed Cyclone to get heal off. \
\
He does a Thunder Clap type move that slows your movement speed (might have done something else as well, but i can't recall). So if you are trying to simply kite him around, try not to get to close.\

    "11371190461201904612007/11/24 14:50:18KremonteSoloable by patient rogues, as well as druids. For rogues, it's a matter of, well, patience, and for druids it's more of a test of gear. There are two packs of soloable myrmidons (two in each pack), as well as one killable patrol with two myrmidons and a caster however that one is very risky.\
\
[b]For rogues[/b], if you have a dodge set, use it. Having preparation helps, and considering AR/prep is flavor of the day, chances are you do. Shadowstep rogues can solo this (I've done it as shadowstep) - however, you'll be using cheat death a good deal to make up for lack of DPS.\
\
[b]For druids[/b], feral is really the only way to go. You can try doing this as mookin, but two elites on you hitting for about 400 per hit (vs moonkin armor) will whittle you down pretty fast. They have 20k HP each, and you have no vanish, so you'll have some trouble. Feral druids, do [b]not[/b] use a cat DPS set. Try your best to whittle them down; your health can get low on two-packs, but you can always cyclone heal.\
\
Pack one: sitting at the gate into the tunnel. Stealth around the side opposite the bog lords when you zone in (they see stealth), turn to your right, and you're looking right at them. Only thing to worry about is the patrol inside the tunnel.\
\
Pack two: patrol in the big open room that leads to the last two bosses. There's two myrmidons (one on each side) and a caster in the middle. If you do end up wanting to fight them, the best position is to do it nearer to the last boss, so you don't get ambushed by any stray mobs.\
\
Pack three: on the way to the second boss, just before the tunnel with slaves, a pack of two. Nothing to worry about.\
\
[b]Rogue strategy[/b]: sap one, kill the other. Unless you have stellar gear, you won't kill it until after sap wears; I would suggest saving evasion as much as you can. Worst case (you get crit a lot), you can vanish and wait it out, or prep evasion (I wouldn't suggest this - 14 mobs is a lot to kill, and prep can be a great timesaver.) Abuse your blind as well; you can get a 55 second sap by blinding as sap fades, buying you extra time. Another nice use of blind is, while sap is still in effect, to blind the mob you're killing and bandage. Generally, after you kill one, you can vanish, re-sap, eat, and then engage - if you have evasion again (i.e. you're combat and you have the lesser cooldown) use it, if your gear isn't great you'll probably want to wait for it's CD to be up.\
\
[b]Feral druid strategy[/b]: open on one of the mobs in cat, and get a few good swings in. As the other mob approaches (which will be nearly instant), shift to bear and let the whittling begin. You won't have any lack of rage with two mobs hitting you, so feel free to spam swipe and pop frenzied rejuv relatively early in the fight. Once that heal wears, hopefully your health won't be too low to bash, shift out and heal. There will still be one mob hitting you, so your only choice may be to rejuv and shift back. Otherwise, just regrowth rejuv and go back into bear. Another possible strategy would be to bash, cyclone, and get in a more satisfying heal, but you will get hit once or twice more in the caster interim. Once the first mob is dead, the second one is easy going; feel free to cat DPS to speed things up, but don't get too low. Against cat the mobs hit around 1000 per smack, and they also have a cleave. Safest bet would be to heal yourself to full when the first mob is dead, and then continue the beardom for the second.\
\
I don't think feral druids can solo the three pack patrol. Without any effective, long term CC, you're really SOL. For prep rogues though, the option is there - you'll need pretty good gear to mitigate damage but also DPS fast enough to kill them though.\
\
The two methods of killing this patrol - sap the caster, and use your normal method of killing, but evasion early and prep evasion soon afterwards, abusing blind afterwards or between the two evasions. You can also sap one myrmidon and kill the other while trying to mitigate the caster damage - evasion doesn't help, or sap one myrmidon and rush down the caster ASAP. Either way, you will definitely need to vanish after killing one to refresh your CC and your HP, and probably wait for evasion again.\
\
No matter what though, it's probably smartest to get a SV group for this. 14 mob kills is a lot, and for a well-geared prep rogue to solo it still takes about two hours to kill the mobs. It's dangerous, and while you get all the armaments that drop, it's still more time-efficient and profitable to take the full run.\
\
... however, if you're a rogue with a druid friend (or vice versa), then go ahead. The druid can heal and add DPS, and you can get down all six mobs per run, completing the entire daily in under an hour.",

First, follow the NPCs up to the manaforge; let them clear the voidwalkers and shriekers for you rather than trying to fight through. Once you give the signal to engage, Captain Saeed will tank while the other ethereals DPS. They're not healable, but Saeed is, and has about 40-50k health. He's buffable with pally buffs; don't know about others. \
\
Our strategy was simple: stand in the manaforge entrance corridor out of range of Dimensius's ranged attacks, but within healing range of Saeed. I kept Saeed healed (required 1 mana pot; it's a long fight) while the hunter DPSed the boss down. At no time did either of us pull agro or take any damage.\

\
Using the little outcrop thats in the hallway you first enter through, I hid behind that and let my mana regen, then when I had enough I'd run out and use excorcism, holy shock (divine favor when it's up) and then run in close and judge Seal of Command. Don't get in melee range or he'll smack you around hardcore. <20% I added Hammer of wrath to my round of attacks.\
\
Once I used these four attacks I'd run back to the hallway and hide so I could bandage/mana regen. This hit and run method only took him down 1-2% each time so it's very time consuming and I used probably 15 heavy netherweave bandages instead of healing with my own mana. \

Very doable however as long no one interferes with you. \

Attempt #1 - I get him to 1-2%, I think it's all over, then he kills me with 3 nukes even though I run round the corner out of LoS after the first. Grrrr...\
\
Attempt #2 - I decide to go slower and make sure that all my cooldowns, trinkets, mana, etc are ready to blast him down quick at the end. So I'm mostly just pinging him with autoshot and it's going much slower after all the npcs die. He starts nuking at about 20% this time >< I FD and he despawns almost immediately.\
\
Attempt #3 - Right, screw that, I buff myself with elixir, food, scrolls and just go all out. Get him down to about 20% before the npc dies, and then finish him off no problem. This time he didn't start nuking at all.\
\
So yeah, I'm guessing that he starts with the nukes after a certain amount of time has passed. Or maybe a certain amount of time after the npc dies. Whichever it is, if you're a solo hunter then you want him dead before that happens because there's not a lot you can do about them.",

first the bug, \
\
make sure you are standing on the platform that summons the quest giver or else the escort NPC will not show.  Tested this numerous times, it only showed up for me while standing on the platform.\
\
Second, the design of the area.\
\
Mobs are tightly packed, here so be careful.  the problem with this quest is that there is way too much shit lying on the ground making it confusing to complete. I didn't know which way the npc would turn towards, he would turn right, and then left, making you aggro the mob to the right, not knowing that you don't have to kill it.\
\
Not to mention the distance from the quest area from the nearest rez point, way to go blizz on keeping me logged in for an extra 12 minutes to run to my corpse. \
\
Third, GG Bliz.\
\
trying to add lore to this quest makes it really stupid.  Not only to i have to deal with summoning the quest giver in a dangerous area, but the summoned NPC escort is just as stupid, i mean there are maybe 4 types of soloable quests in this game, why would you have to make this one any different by adding a summonable NPC in an aggroable area ? \

They will aggro you, but just pull them around till the demolitionist has passed, then fly up. You immediately loose aggro from the melee mobs, and a bit higher you loose from the casters (you have to get out of range of course).\
\
Don't believe that the demolitionist doesn't aggro, though you might be tricked by him, because he keeps on walking.",

Work your way north towards the transport pad, killing everything in the way and even some stuff a bit out of the way. Hopefully, by the time you hit the pad and summon the demolitionist, everything south of you will have been cleared and you'll just have to deal with the 3 adds at the end.\

Strangely, the 3 adds at the end are pretty easy Nexus Stalkers, much like the ones you fought while questing at Area 52. Dunno why the Archons and Overlords wanna turn into them, but it does make finishing this quest much easier.",

It's really hard to clear a path because there are so many mobs and they respawn very fast and you don't know exactly what his path is the first time.  On top of that, he stops along the way to sightsee and make comments - he can't talk while he walks, he has to stop and gape at stuff.

For the legionnaires, you can pull these without aggro'ing the cannons, hit from range with anything but serpent sting. Turn pet growl off, place freeze trap on ground and back up, keep shooting. he gets trapped, wait for trap cooldown.... (helps to have survival spec with 30sec trap CD) pop trap with aimed shot, shoot more place trap, repeat until dead. \
\
for the engineers. use the basic pet tank and mend strat, your pet will probably die unless you have alot more stam than i did, after pet dies, do your best to follow the legionnaire strat, the engineers have a magnetic pull which makes it more difficult, but it is still possible. \
\
Tinkerers, have pet attack the pack of 4 making sure that he gets hits on 2-3, cast mend pet, this will aggro 1-2 onto you, trap 1. then just kill 'em. they are simple. \

Its definitely less common from them then it is on the next to quest encounters in the chain. The Legionnaires are just a straight melee type elite, hit fairly hard..

\
The Black Temple attunement starts at The Altar of the Sha'tar for Aldors, and the Sanctum of the Sun for Scryers. Both are in Shadowmoon Valley.\
\
Aldors start attunement from Anchorite Ceyla (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21402) at the Altar of Sha'tar in Shadowmoon Valley:\

6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10628 [70] Akama\
7. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10705 [70] Seer Udalo\
\

8. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10706 [70] A Mysterious Portent\
9. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10707 [70] The Ata'mal Terrace\
10. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10708 [70] Akama's Promise\
\
After you finish this chain, you get to pick from some rewards and the chain seems like it ends. It continues however, inside Serpentshrine Cavern (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3607) from an NPC called Seer Olum (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22820) who you can speak with after killing Fathom-Lord Karathress. He starts the next part of the Black Temple Chain by offering the quest:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10944 [70] The Secret Compromised\
For this quest you just return to Akama.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10946 [70] Ruse of the Ashtongue\
In this quest, you must use the costume Akama provides, and kill A'lar in Tempest Keep: The Eye while wearing the Ashtongue Cowl. Attunement for The Eye is a whole different chain.\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10947 [70] An Artifact From the Past\
In this, you need to gain access to The Battle of Mount Hyjal in Caverns of Time, and slay the first boss, Rage Winterchill. Attunement for this involves killing Lady Vashj and Kael'Thas Sunstrider.\
4. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10948 [70] The Hostage Soul\
For this you must speak with A'dal in Shattrath city.\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10949 [70] Entry into the Black Temple\
For this, just speak with the naaru Xi'ri in front of Black Temple.\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10985 [70] A Distraction for Akama\
Unknown what this quest asks of you, most likely you need to defend Xi'ri and make your way into Black Temple. At the end, you become attuned to enter and are granted The Medallion of Karabor (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32649)\
\
At this point, you are attuned and can enter Black Temple, although the chain continues and you can soon upgrade your medallion. It continues with:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10958 [70] Seek Out the Ashtongue\
You just need to find Seer Kanai (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=23158) inside Black Temple.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10957 [70] Redemption of the Ashtongue\
This involves entering Black Temple, and killing the boss the Shade of Akama (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22841).\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10959 [70] The Fall of the Betrayer\
After killing the Shade of Akama and returning to Seer Kanai, he asks one last thing of you. Kill Illidan The Betrayer. After doing so, you are granted the Blessed Medallion of Karabor, an upgraded version of your original medallion, and allows teleportation to the Black Temple.",

\
I started at low altitude. Click the bomb (set to hotkey) and mouse over the ground and lower yourself until the targeting circle changes to green. As you swoop by, left click to drop a bomb. Then hit space bar to start rising up and avoid the incoming attacks.\
\
NOTE: I got hit being careless and not lifting up, but I landed on an adamantite deposit and mined it, lol.\
\
EDIT: After a little experience doing this, the tactic of flying down at your targets at a 45 degree angle seems to work much better and is safer. Watch for the roided out fel reavers they can knock you off your mount.",

    "1101014367351885542007/08/25 03:50:47blupacheAnother thing to remember is that spacebar = fly up and x = fly down.\
\
I generally mount up out of range, get some height & then divebomb down at ~45 degrees towards an ammo pile, strafing from left to right & using spacebar occasionally. You get a good view of the shots coming at you because you'll generally be flying virtually directly into a cannon with two others further away to left & right.\
\
Sticking to using the keyboard to dodge means you can have the bomb active & just click the mouse as soon as the sight appears. Once the bomb starts to channel its throw, i'll immediately swerve & fly low directly away from the cannon using the mouse to steer and basically weaving it in an infinity symbol pattern (â) while still strafing left & right.\
\
I find I'll always score a hit with this and get shot down about 1 time in 5 runs - but only ever while I'm flying away and, because I'm flying low then, I take stuff all falling damage & end up taking ~3k damage at most. Worst case situation you'll end up in a fight with one of the patrolling demon while on lower health.\
\
The down side of this approach is that doing one at a time is slow & you need to be selective with which ammo dumps you attack. On the other hand, I've never yet had to run back to my body & foot the repair bill either, despite being on a 60% speed flight mount. And it's a lot more fun than just jumping on & off your mount at ground level.",

    "11010103711301037112007/06/13 13:49:13PleegWatI have found the following tactic to work for me.\
\
First: make sure you have turn left/right, strafe left/right, ascend (jump) and descend hotkeyed, and can reach them all in any sensible combination with one hand. Also check if all these combinations work, there are combinations of 3 keys that do not work correctly for hardware reasons.\
\
Now:\
1) get on your mount well away from the demon camp\
2) make sure your flight is level\
3) do not use the right mouse button from this stage onward, till you're done\
4) change to a top down view (but maintain level flight)\
5) fly to the demon camp of your preference.\
6) Use your move keys to avoid the flak.\
7) Use your hotkey to select the bombs.\
8) Pick your target\
9) Dive down, keep avoiding the flak.\
10) Once in range, bombs away!\
11) Immediately move back up (keep avoiding that flak)\
12) Wait till the bombs are off cooldown\
13) Repeat till done",

If you're just flying by this place and have cannons shooting at you from a far, you can chill and just fly straight forward without any problems but if you're really close up (like when you're bombing) you'll need to move very irregular (going up and down helps aswell).",

The flak is somewhat random and won't always focus on the exact spot you were at 2 secs ago. I found the easiest way to do this quest is to have the bomb hotkeyed then:\
\
1. Stop in front of a stack of cannonballs unmounted\
2. Click mount then mouseover the cannonball stack \
3. As soon as you're mounted Click the bomb action then immediately dismount \
4. Ideally no flak whatsoever will be fired at you in that short time but just in case strafe away and you'll be fine.\

    "11010134958201349582007/08/09 13:56:07ZarakosEven without an epic mount or flight form, this is extremely easy. \
\
I found out a very effective move, that gets you up and down the air with a 90% chance of missing flak. All you do is either W+D(or A)+Spacebar. This sends you to do an ascending corkscrew. To descend just push S instead of W. Because you are constantly turning in a corkscrew, you can keep your vision still by holding down the left mouse button. \
\
Unless I wrote this wrong, this will constantly confuse flak, while at the same time, you can move up or down. To bomb the ammo though, you will have to use your own method of advancing toward it. This move is only useful when you try to avoid flak, especially in the area where flak fire is very abundant.\
\
And for druids, have no fear of being shot down and dying. If there isn't any spellcaster mobs nearby, you can simply click on flight form again when shot down and resume flying. Remember to heal yourself when fel fire takes too much of your health away.",
    "11010106216501062162007/06/17 22:07:45UrbanGypsyAs a holy priest with a non-epic flying mount I have to admit I gave up after the first two bombing runs.  Following the \"keep moving\" tactic on a slow mount involved more button mashing and twitching than was fun for me.  Went back there again tonight though, and developed a tactic that makes life MUCH easier:\
\
1. As many folk have said, make sure you put your bomb on a hotkey\
\
2. Stay on the ground at all times.  You don't have to be airborn to use the bombs; only mounted on your flying mount (or in flight form)\
\
3. And here's the bit that really made my life easier... don't mount unless you're ready to bomb. On the whole I found the mobs were fairly well spaced apart (with a bit of forward thinking in terms of which ones were wandering towards each other), so you could easily run around in between them without having to fight anything.  So long as you're not mounted, you're not being fired at.  I just ran along to the next stack of cannonballs, mounted up, set the bomb off and dismounted again.  Heal up if necessary, rinse and repeat.\
\
Hope that helps anyone else who was still having a hard time of it.",
    "110109078541904312007/05/26 05:39:19FalrinnI was able to do this quest simply by flying erratically and droping bombs whenever I got in range.  Sometimes I'd clear an entire area of cannonballs without the flak cannons halting fire once.\
\
As long as you fly at awkward angles  and keep changing direction the flak cannons can't hit you and your free to drop as many bombs as you need.",
    "110109502250950222007/05/31 22:54:52laughingdogFor those with epic mounts, the easiest method for this can be summed up with two words:  Strafing Run.\
\
Put the bomb on a hotkey.  Hover at the edge of the camp.  Set a bearing that will pass you off to the side slightly of your target using your right mouse button.  Then shift your camera angle down about 45 degrees from horizontal with the left mouse button. Once you have that set, just hold down W, press your bomb hotkey, and click as you buzz over your target.\
\
I find that it helps a little to press the space bar right after I've dropped the bomb to get some altitude.  You don't have to stay near the target to wait for the bomb to hit.  As long as your aim was good, you'll get credit, all while being nowhere near the cannon fire.  I typically get a bombing run done in less than 5 minutes with this method, and haven't been hit yet after 4 runs.",

\
1. Walk/ride up to within bomb range on a non-flying mount.  You should be outside of aggro range still.\
2. Mount up on your flying mount.\
3. Toss bomb.\
4. Dismount.\
5. Move away quickly from where you were standing, because the cannons will aim their fire there.\

    "11010124268201242682007/07/20 23:28:15RandomixxBoth methods are fine to use, it just depends on your playstyle I guess. For example, at first I tried the âfly out of Flak Cannon range then dive in avoiding cannon fireâ tactic and died about four times without even getting in range of the cannonballs once(Gear unequipped of course). After that I gave up and tried the ground-based approach, it made life much easier because the mobs were constantly being farmed, but it was also absurdly slow as I spent more time bandaging then bombing due to latency. So I tried the âfly erraticallyâ approach again, and decided to write up a bit of a guide to the way I did it. Simply because all of these people who just tell us to âQQ less and keep movingâ (Or any version of that) have little, if any, description in their posts as to HOW to âkeep movingâ.\
\
Step One: Go to Forge Camp of choice, pick a âsafe spotâ just outside the camp where the cannons canât get you, and hop on your flying mount (My âsafe spotâ is just outside the âenergy barrierâ of Shartuulâs Transporter for that quest). Now fly up so youâre about 10-20 metres off the ground in-game.\
\
Two: Start flying towards a Fell Cannonball Stack near the edge of the camp, it is okay to fly straight at this point, as you will not be in range yet.\
\
Three: Keep an eye on the Fell Cannons! If you see one turns towards you, it is about to fire at you: Hit one of your strafing keys and either the spacebar or X key (These are default controls BTW) at the same time. This will make you move diagonally up or down, and the Flak will explode either above or below and slightly behind you. If you do get hit though, you are nice and close to the ground, so the fall will NOT kill you (I even had a few incidents where I didnât take falling damage at all!). Also, donât be afraid to run on the ground, the closer you are to the ground, the better this strategy seems to work.\
\
Tip: Iâve noticed that the cannons tend to fire in volleys of three to four flaks, then will not fire again for at least three seconds, use this time to your advantage!\
\
Four: Once in range of the stack, click your bomb on the hotbar and quickly click the stack, then hit spacebar and strafe away from the Fel Cannon next to the target. At this point you can either go for another Cannonball Stack, or return to your âsafe spotâ (Because the cannons are behind you, you might want to turn the camera around for this) and wait out the cooldown on your bombs.\
\
I hope this helps everyone who has been having trouble with this quest, but the main problem I may have here is that it might not work with epic fliers-I did this on a normal flying mount (still 2000 gold short of the epic one -_-) - because they move faster and thus would technically have less reaction time for getting fired at.",

\
1. Put up Fire Ward before you mount & throw the bomb. It will absorb most of the damage if you do get hit.\
\
2. Blink to start Steps 4 & 5 in the comment above mine. It dismounts you, so you won't still be a target, and gets you farther away from the cannon's first target spot faster.\

It seemed a little slow my first time through, but on my second run it went much faster. Far better than trying to fly erratically and still target while on a non-epic mount.",

    "1099895469370954692007/06/01 15:49:21KathuckaTo explain the full event....\
\
The event takes place in a ring near the bridge to Netherstorm.  There are five small circles of fire around the edge of the ring.\
\
When characters stand in the circles, red lines form between them.  So, each occupied circle is linked by a red line to the other occupied circles.  When all five circles are filled, the red lines form a pentagram, and Vim'gol, an ogre warlock, is summoned.\
\
Vim'gol will pause for a couple seconds and complain, during which time he is invulnerable.  He will then attack whoever was the last character to step into a circle.\
\
He attacks with a heavy melee hit and a Shadow Bolt Volley that hits everyone nearby.  A tank, a healer, and some solid damage-dealers are highly recommended for this encounter.\
\
At 50% health, Vim'gol announces that he's going to grow large and smash everything.  He then runs to the center of the ring and channels a \"growth\" spell for 10 seconds.  If five characters get in their circles and re-form the pentagram, it will interrupt his cast, and he will not grow.  If it completes, he will be very large, dish out substantially more damage, and likely wipe the attempt.\
\
When he dies, a container appears at his feet.  Loot it for the quest item.\
\
Some tips:\
\
Have your tank enter the fire last.  That way, he'll head directly for the tank.\
\
Healers, ranged damage-dealers, and the tank should not move until the the growth spell is dispelled.  If all five characters simply stay in their circles after the event starts, the growth will never happen.  Only melee damage -dealers need to run around.\
\
Everyone will be taking damage.  Use potions and bandages to relieve pressure on the healer.  Five living characters are required to stop the growth buff, so make sure you're alive at least that long.\
\
The quest item container appears to be lootable by anyone with the quest.  There is no need to be in on the kill or the summon.\
\
Since it's an outdoor event, characters outside the group can assist with healing and damage-dealing, to break the five-man group size and make the event considerably easier.\
\
Despite the experience of some well-geared players who have commented here, it's considerably easier to finish this event if he does not get his growth buff.  Do run to the circles.\
\
Make sure that you are not standing in the circles of fire when Vim'gol dies!  If you are, he will be instantly summoned again, and at full health!  You can still loot his quest item if this happens, though.",

The best place for finding eggs on the ground is deep in the mines, and check the slime/worm area every so often theres a good chance of spotting them, always keep an eye out for eggs, if you are in an area with other players that if you arent looking for the eggs they will get it before you",

I've seen one respawn behind the two elite drakes near the 'dock' where Netherwing Transporters land and fly off from, and it respawned in the same exact place. However, getting it required one person distracting the drakes because it was too close to them to open up without aggroing.\
\
I've also seen them drop off the Nethermine Flayers more than once, though it's rather rare most of the time. I have also seen some spawn at different places in the cave, but finding them is tough since the mines are so camped most of the time.\
\
Some other things to note:\
\
1. Like Sasquatchiii said, if you're grouped you roll need/greed on the eggs if you come across one on a mob or 'open' a spawned egg up.\
\
2. They DO stack, I think either to 10 or 20 per stack, but not sure because I only have 5 at the moment. \
\
3. You only get the gold reward once on the FIRST turn in, and any eggs turned in after that just net you 250 rep.\
\
4. You can turn in as many as you like in one day as the quest to turn them in IS NOT considered a daily quest.\
\
5. A spawned egg is considered to be like a treasure chest in that you CANNOT open it up if you're in combat. You have to be OUT of combat to open it up and get the egg.",

\
I cannot find the section you claim to be quoting on the official site, all of it supports what has been previously stated by the other posters here. Multiple 10% trinkets/auras/talents don't stack, that is the only restriction - spurs, carrots, and glove enchants still stack with eachother, giving an 8% total increase, but none of them will stack with either talents, auras, or 10% trinkets.\
\
The riding crop, Crusader Aura, the hunter talent to increase mounted speeds, and indeed the reward from this quest all increase your speed multiplicatively, NOT purely as a base increase. That does indeed mean that using a crop while on an epic flying mount will increase your speed by (100%+280%)/10 = 38% overall, giving you a new top speed of 418% of normal running speed. This observation is repeatably demonstrable through using one of the many player speed displays.\
\
As for \"common knowledge\" stating that taxis fly at 300%, I'd like to know which common people you hang out with. Taxis fly from between 200 and 400% faster depending on their route and direction, with the average straight/level speed being approximately 428% which, surprise surprise, is 10% slower than the 418% speed you can achieve on an epic flying mount when equipped with a riding crop!

He will also try to fake you out making 360, but use this time to get ahead, becuase he will ALWAYS turn back around when he does this.  I could see this tricking you to follow back into the fireballs and dismount.\

\
- [b]AddOn ImprovedCamera[/b]: Increases limit of the Max Camera Distance slider in Interface Options to the very maximum possible (from 30 to 50).\
\
http://wow.curse.com/downloads/details/5098/\
\
- [b]Youtube videos[/b]: Learning his path makes things much easier, watch it over and over: \
\
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnAsBOEt7BY\
\
- [b]Turn off your UI:[/b] Press alt+Z to turn off your interface, so everything on the screen disappears and you can see Skyshatter easier when he gets distance.\
\
- [b]Raid Mark him[/b]: Invite some guildmate or random guy to a party, so you can add a mark icon to his head. Personally I used the blue square.\
\
- [b]Buy a Riding Crop:[/b] If you're farming for your netherdrake, you surely have 60-100g to spend on a riding crop. It sucks that after you win this chain of quests you get a riding crop as a reward, but to beat mulverick and captain skyshatter you MUST have this, otherwise it gets close to impossible.\
\
With the tips above, you can easily solo this guy. If you have friends, call them to be hit by his bolts instead of you, and a pally to give you crusader aura.\
\
Hope you all can do it faster than I did, good luck!",
    "1107195339150953392007/06/01 12:16:40SuhovOk, 4 days of try's and I did it. Crap thing sometimes NPC get bugged and no one can take quest again until server restard or GM fix it manualy (takes around 5 hours). Riding Crop is must have for this race because he got 310% mount and you get 280%, but with crop you will get same speed as he is. To laught on you Blizz give another riding crop as reward then you complete this.\
\
Tips:\
* Race is shorter then Mulverik one. Learn his route.\
* Beware other racers because it is tooo gay to fall off mount in case of non Skyshatter bomb something near finish. =)\
* Fly after Skyshater on distance like 1,5-2 size of your mount.\
* If there is queue invite all players of your side to group (not raid) and start together. Even if someone falls other quest will still work. However you will not receive credit for quest if you fall but you reduce queue much. It is nessesary if there is like 134565 players waiting for Skyshatter.\
* Don't be afraid of flying NPCs which attack you. They hit for 250-400 even when naked you have enough HP to survive. So if shorter way thourgh skyraiders - don't affraid.\
* It's depending on style ofcourse but I reccomend you to fly in that way: Turning and moving with mouse (so, all flyght you had to press both mouse buttons non-stop) and correct altitude to avoid meteors with \"X\" (default \"fly down key\") and \"Space (default \"fly up\" key).\
* They Skyshatter rotate for 24 hours for 2-4 sec (he does this lag like 2-4 times on whjole race) unpress your Right mouse key and look with mouse to his position. They you find him press right mouse button and fly to him. However still move updown because meteors can fly above Skyshatter.\

But what it shows: since Skyshatter drop a meteor and you see falling meteor it is not dangerous. How ever after 1 sec or so it will explode and this area (around 2 yard radius) is dangerous. If you got nice green ping ( I made this quest with 700 ms) then you will ever seen that places.",
    "11071130026101300262007/07/31 19:31:29VorphDragonmaw race quests are the most entertaining quests I've completed by far. I have not yet managed to beat Skyshatter but just an advice, when you got aggravated, stop trying to do the quest for a while, because it takes all the fun part and since you get more distracted when you get angry, you wont be able to do quest therefore wasting a huge amount of time. This quest requires a good connection, a good memory, good control over your mouse and keyboard and preferably a riding crop :), nothing else.\
\
By the way Skyshatter sometimes go in circles at the same location for around 30 seconds when doing this quest, towards the end. This is somehow pure luck as far as I know, because several times I experienced that sequence and most of the time I didn't. It's also noticable on youtube videos having different time lengths because of this difference during the flight sequence.",

Maybe I just got lucky but I can say this quest, as far as i can tell, is pretty impossible without a riding crop.\
\
Tips:\
1. On the first time dont try, just kind of try and memorize his flight path.\
2. try to stay above and left of him.\
3. When he makes his turns try to stay on the inside so you dont get to far behind.\
4. Near the beginning in the crystals where he makes his second spin around do NOT follow him in,just stay above,ahead,and to the right.\
5. He goes up several mountains so just go around the base instead of following him up the tip.\
6. Do not fly to close to him because if you touch him it will dismount you.\
7. At the beginning he does a U turn so just go about half way into the U and then turn back around and almost immediatly start flying for the top of the tower to the right of the runway.\
\
I hope these help!\
\
P.S.\
If you are a druid you can just reshift if knocked off your mount, shouldn't take but a couple tries for you.\
\
Also this quest is much easier if you are/with a paladin.\
\
Lastely, don't try to put someone on follow and hae them do it for you, it won't work because when he dodges a ball you'll just be put where he was and get knocked off.",

The 2nd time I remembered to keep my carrot on the stick for it. Yes it was a bitch to do, both times.\
\
I like to think of this quest as a test of skill. I know quite a few people who have this quest but have never completed it, and still think they are \"pro\" at the game. The fact is, is that this quest is a solo quest that blizzard put in the game. Anyone who considers themselves pro shouldn't say a solo quest is too hard for them.",

You definatly dont need a riding crop to do it, but I can see how helpful it is when it comes to the \"straights\" :)",
    "1107189158270891582007/05/24 05:04:26MireiI think I spent a good hour working on this quest before finally completing it.\
\
Get used to his yell, \"Prepare a funereal pyre!  <Name> has challenged Skyshatter!\"\
\
The trick here is to remain within range of him (which I think is no greater than 15 YDs, MUCH less than the others), while avoiding a bombardment of 'meteors' that shower around him.\
\
If you remain rather close to him the entire time (He must have 280% flight speed...  I could NEVER duck and dodge without him getting too far ahead), he'll end up soaking up most of the meteors, himself.  Not to be corny, but trust your instincts.  He'll lead you to victory.  His flight is much shorter than Mulvericks, but about three times as annoying.  \

Good luck, potential Skybreakers.\

\
You must remember about some things:\
\
1. Don't fly behind him. Fly some at right or left.\
2. He uses a lot more tricks than previous riders. He does some back-forward moves, and very often big dive in air. That can allow him to run off from you.\
3. Noggenfogger Elixir helps here A LOT. Drink it until you'll be small, then accept quest. With that buff you can practily ignore meteors.\

The races leading up to this one were great, but a riding crop is not a great reward for a quest that it's a good idea (not necessary though) to have a riding crop on while doing it to begin with.\
\
Honestly, the 1000 rep is great, but considering rep grinding for this faction is so easy to do in the first place - this quest is hardly worth the effort and meaningless/unnecessary aggravation it creates to achieve the goal.\
\
This is really the only quest in the game, it seems, that it takes a double-digit number of attempts to complete; and doesn't offer a reward that merits its difficulty.",

He is very easy once you know what to do and practice a little bit. Did on Pally, so Crusader Aura helped a ton. Only took me about 7 tries, and def go naked.",
    "11071116702201167022007/07/06 21:12:01ArmageddaBasically the best way to do this is to take the very popular strategy from Mulverick (staying right on top of him) and doing one better to stay above and ahead of Skyshatter.\
\
Granted, the execution of it is tricky as hell, and it took me a couple of hours to perfect, but it's by the far easiest way to do it. If you tag along beside him, you will get shot down a lot of times simply because you don't have that little head start to adjust when he moves, and it's far harder to see where you're going in terms of crystals and other nasty stuff sticking out from the walls around you.\
\
There's been some talk about using a \"meteor\" tank, which I tried with one of my friends. He had me doing my thing above Skyshatter, attracting all the meteors, while he tagged along behind him completely out of danger. Problem with that is if your meteor tank gets shot down, you're on your own again, as well as the obvious challenge of finding a guy good enough to fly ahead of you in the first place. If you can though, it'll be a load off your mind.\
\
As many others have said, keep trying at this guy, don't get discouraged. Once you have his route down, try flying above and ahead of him, it's damn rewarding when it works, and you very rarely have to worry about his meteors.\
\
It goes without saying that I fully recommend using a Riding Crop. Those are cheap on most servers anyway, and come on, if you've done the Netherwing daylies to Honored, you can damn well afford it by then.",

Without Crusader or a Riding Crop, I maintained to stay next to him the whole time even when he made u-turns. Another tip, don't fly too close. He discharges a little firestorm and it can be easily avoided. For those meteors, it hits like 5% of the time if you fly zig zag.\

Fly side by side with him @ approx 10 yards away from him as he almost never shoots his meteors there, don't know if this is possible with a riding crop and the huge downside with this strat is that you have to know about where he turns so you can go lower as you turn if he turns to you or do a sharper turn if he turns away.\

Admittedly, I tried doing the eagle spirit in feral dps gear first (stupid maybe, but it worked well enough to tank Terokk as resto for some guildies cause my tanking gear is normally in the bank when I'm resto), but dying and having to spirit rezz twice is nonetheless annoying.\
The third time, in my tanking gear, I very barely managed to kill him. Of course, knowing to use demo roar, and knowing to save up bash for when he casts starfire helps, but it was still a very close call.\
The next spirit, the one you fight in cat form, killed me as well, at which point a mage from my guild jumped in to help. \

\
After a short series of releasing and running, I found the statue, but at a different set of coordinates.  My suggestion (if you are Alliance) is to start at 44, 45 and head due East to 46, 45 (which is the actual location of the Statue).  Oh, and don't forget to go AROUND the Horde town or atleast fly high enough not to get agro.\
\
I did this in cat form with crappy gear.  I summoned the guy and immediately shifted into cat form and stealthed.  It took a few seconds before it let me attack him while he was spurting off at the mouth telling me what a bad kitty I was, but I didn't mind the brief wait as it allowed my energy to go to full before entering combat.\
\
As soon as I could attack him, I Pounce'd and Faerie Fire'd him.  From there I just Mangle'd and Ferocious Bite'd him to death.  When he died, his two adds that he had summoned, depsawned.  I was still at 60% health when he died and I ignored the adds during the fight.  I have no doubt that he would have summoned more than two had the fight lasted longer.\

\
For those trying this -- this is bad advice.  Based on my experience, you can NOT do this quest resto-speced in healer gear.  I was demo roaring every time it was up, but you still are going to take a few 200-ish hits as the adds come in and you're not going to be doing enough damage to the boss to outrace the incoming damage, even with a frenzied regeneration.  And if you fail, yes you have to spirit rez.\

If you're a resto druid, I strongly advise bringing a friend.",

Second Half\
Silroth can be found at 41,20.  I cleared the bowl that the demon sits in and used the same strategy as above.  No kiting needed.  Just DoTs, fear, Drain Life, repeat as necessary.\

    "110609461830946182007/05/31 09:39:25KeekuliHere's how far I've gotten in the event: \
First part as the fel guard is really easy, just fear, charge and whirlwind the trash, and hammer the shield every time the cd allows you. Once the shield is down, comes the green demon guy (no need to use crystal foci or whatever in the first part nor the green dude). Just spam the basic attack and whenever he does fel flames, fear and charge. \
\
After this it get's a little trickier though quite easy still. Use fel flames everytime you can, if the little guys start making cannon, use the leap attack and after that drain life from a mob which has a good amount left. Continue this until a big guy shows up, I just spammed him with the basic attack and once in a while do the leap/drain combo. Also use the throw axe ability all the time. Here I had to use one crystal foci thing to do the bombing attack which practically killed all the enemies(remember that you can use your other skills too when flying, drain here) \
\
After you've killed quite lot of the little guys and if I remember correctly 4-6 big guys, you face the shivan assasin. She does siphon life, and death blast or something which drains life to her, and sometimes frost nova and possibly flame buffet+fireball. Here you have to keep her stunned as much of the time possible. I was very close to die but managed to kill her too. \
\
In the next part you control (surprise surprise) the shivan assasin. This part, at least for me, felt very hectic. She has 3 \"aspects you can change every 30s. Shadow aspect has siphon life, and the same shadow attack that drains life if the mob is affected by siphon life + shadow nova. Fire aspect has flame buffet, fireball and some aoe which possibly had a debuffing effect(didn't really have time to read carefully) . And the Ice aspect has a frost nova which jumps her backwards, ice blast or something and a spell similar with ice block. Also the special attack she has(that uses 2 charged crystal focus's this time) does much damage and extra if the mob is affected by one of the debuffs she can do.\
\
You'll be fighting a beholder which killed me quite quickly. It casts a deathray attack (you get the \"Eye of shartuul is focusing or something in your chat) which I think should be avoided with ice block. I can't tell much about this fight since it was kind of  chaotic and he killed me quite quickly.\
\
I'm interested in knowing what's beyond, so please add more info as you get further",
    "11060141462201414622007/08/21 00:28:09TheololWatch out, do this quest as often as you can and don't stack up both kinds of Darkrunes, here's why:\
\
It surely doesn't work to keep a Darkrune, a Crystalforged Darkune and a Kronk's Grab Bag... If you hold all these and let the daily reset happen, you have basically just lost a shot at the Shartuul event.\
\
So, how to avoid this? Just be aware that you can't hold more than one of each of these 3 unique items, and do the Shartuul event ahead of getting full, or on the same day you got a new bag. Always remember to open the bag when you get it, if you can't, that means you need to do the event as soon as possible, because obviously it has a new Darkrune in it. You need to use your current Crystalforged Darkrune and do the event before the next reset. This will allow you to do the event as well as Crystalforge a new one afterwards, since it all took place the same day.\
\
However, if you have all of them and Gahk doesn't have the \"Yous Have Da Darkrune?\" quest, then you have let the reset go by. In this case you have already lost one darkrune whatever you do, when that happens you should just delete the bag so you can turn-in the \"Banish More Demons\" quest (usually it will be after having the quest done again and returning to the NPCs that you'll realize you already messed up by not having done it the day before). Being able to turn-in this quest is key to being able to Crystalforge a new Darkrune, so just getting rid of the bag is the single thing you need to do. You can also just delete the plain one and open the bag, same results = no bag, Darkrune, Crystalforged Darkrune. Then you can turn-in the quest and receive a new bag as normal.\
\
To be safe, always keep only one Darkrune or none, not both plain and Crystalforged because you might not have time (or remember) to do the event again before the next daily reset.\
\
The reset is at 4:00 EU, but in fact you should always do dailies preferably before 3:00 realm EU, turning in dailies after that time will make them done for the next day as well - this doesn't show right at the reset, but will happen when you log back in hours later, so you can still do them again right after the reset.\
\
Also, there will be a Raw Darkrune ( http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32642 ) item coming in a patch. This will apparently stack up to 20 and work in the same way as a normal Darkrune, 1 for each Shartuul event, therefore different than the Fragments ( http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33784 ), which will also be patched in. It's a quest item, so it's likely for it to come with a new repeatable quest, to allow you to turn it into a normal, unique Darkrune. This will allow you to Crystalforge a lot more than the 2 you currently can each day, so that in theory you can stack up the event 22 times and then do it in a single day... But mainly, it's obviously to prevent people from just losing their Darkrunes when they don't do the event along with the dailies for a couple days at a time.",

    "1106093141300931412007/05/29 12:57:57DettonThe Crystalforged Darkrune is used to do an event at Shartuul's Transporter at the northern forge camp, Forge Camp: Wrath, on the westernmost plateau in Blade's Edge (the one with the Ogri'la camp) \
\
The quest to get a darkrune, which is then exchanged for a crystalforged darkrune, can only be gotten at Honored with Ogri'la, and it involves the quest Banish the Demons http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=11026\
\
The first time you do this quest at honored, you are guarenteed a darkrune.  The daily version of the quest does not guarentee a darkrune - at least, the bag you get as a reward says to \"cross your fingers for a darkrune.\"\
\
Using the Crystalforged Darkrune at the transporter will have you take control of the roaming demon that can't otherwise be targeted.  Your character is \"stunned\" for the duration and your view shifts to the demon's.\
\
As Jeoh says, you can used Charged Crystal Focus (charged with 10 apexis shards from a Depleted Crystal Focus) to activate an ability which will heal the demon.  \
\
Warning:  During a bit of lag, I had clicked repeatedly on the \"heal\" skill, and accidently consumed all of my charged crystal foci (five of them at the time) - There is a cooldown to the ability, but... Just be careful.\
\
The demon has five abilities:\
\
1.)  Mortal Strike.   Hits a demon for about 10,000 damage, very short cooldown.  This will one-shot any of the little demons that come after you.\
\
2.)  Whirlwind.  Hits all enemies around you for 4k-5k damage.  It is similar to Herod's whirlwind from Scarlet Monestary, or the Whirlwind Axe - you must stay in place or else you will break the channeling of the whirlwind.  This has a fairly long cooldown, so use it when you have a lot of fel hounds around you.\
\
3.)  AOE fear.  I can't remember the names precisely (as I do not have a darkrune to do the event right now) - Medium cooldown, it fears - as you'd expect - everything around you for a short time.  This can give you a needed breather and help you wait out other cooldowns.  (such as whirlwind)\
\
4.)  Destructive Charge.   Short cooldown (not as short as mortal strike) this will charge an enemy and do a MASSIVE amount of damage to everything around it, around 20,000.   It has a minimum range so it's hard to use on anything but the imps, which stand back and throw fire at you.  However, any dogs attacking you will likely follow and be caught in the explosion.\
\
Against the stronger demon, if you use the AOE fear,  you can then charge for a good amount of damage.\
\
5.)  Throw hammer.  (Forgot the exact name, again) - Will throw a hammer at the shield, which is your primary objective, doing a lot of damage to it (but it has no health bar) - it takes 4-5 hammers before something stronger then the hounds and imps come after you.\
\
6.)  Finally, there is the heal.  The wording of the ability states that it drains health from everything around you.  I could not get it to work properly though when fighting a group of the fel hounds.  This ability consumes one charged crystal focus and has a long cooldown.  Use it around your 3rd or 4th hammer to make sure you have full health for the big fight.\
\
Unfortunately, I failed BOTH my attempts for today, the day I finally reached Honored and got this quests, so what lies after this event for the reward, I do not know.\
\
If anyone would care to post a successful attempt and what you get from it, it would be useful.  Also, correcting me on the names of the demon's abilities, and exact cooldowns, would be appreciated too.  I will have to wait until tomorrow to do the event again and re-check.",
    "110609308350930832007/05/29 11:24:53JeohYou can use Charged Crystal Foci to use the special abilities of the various demons you control during this quest.",
    "110609332631931412007/05/30 00:08:57BorntorunI went beyond. Not much tho.\
With your felguard you have to defeat the demon that pops out the Transporter. How to defeat the winged demon: Fear-charge-mortal strike-whirlwind whole channelled. Repeat. Better you have between 40-50% of your felguard HP be4 facing it. Then the winged demon should be ready to be submitted.\
When it is at about 25%-20% you gain control of that winged demon and new wave of mobs appear.\
New mobs are of 3 kinds:\
- mini fel cannons (stand in place shotting at you)\
- Mechanar netherbomb throwers shaped mobs (only melee hits)\
- Mechanar minibosses shaped mobs (strongest ones, poison spray skill, not many around)\
\
It has a really unusual way of fighting, since it has these skills (can't remember names, I try to write 'em as accurate as I can):\
\
- Double attack: on single target, slows target's attack speed\
- Fel flames: channelled cone of fel flames for huge dmg in front of caster\
- Super jump: target a ranged enemy to activate. Good damage and aoe stun on melee enemies. Damage even on landing.\
- Throw axe: ranged attack\
- Life steal: usable only on the smallest enemies at min 10 - max 20 yards range.\
- Rain of fel flames: long cooldown and uses a reagent (probably a charged crystal focus)... tooltip says something like \"float in the air and destroy all the enemies\"... used it while surrounded by mobs but didn't worked (can't even remember if I had the reagent in bags)... dunno if it has to be used during the jump (will try tomorrow).\
\
I dunno what's the point you need to achieve... probably simply kill all enemies.\
The thing is damn funny... can't really w8 to have another chance (tried 3 times by now)!",

2 must-do procedures:\
\
1. Salvation on all dps players, except for fury warrior.  All players must be focused on watching & stopping the castings of both bosses - aka: interrupt/stun/kick/etc.\

He will do several things, but nothing horribly overbearing to wipe you without knowing about it.\
\
You cannot heal the NPCs so this is mainly about killing Socethar as fast as possible without pulling aggro. Don't do this without a serious 5 man group.",

    "10409128047401280472007/07/28 01:02:33ElvenLordOk.. the full story would be,\
3 Aldor NPCs spawn, and you tell one of them that \"I'm ready.\"\
\
NPCs will proceed to Socrethar. They will start talking, after a while Kaylaan will spawn and Socrethar will cast a spell on him and make him fight us.\
\
Kaylaan will cast \"Heal\" when he is low on HP, can be interrupted. Just simply take him down.\
\
Soon after, Ishanah will spawn and start talking again.\
Ishanah and the other 2 Aldor NPCs will attack Socrethar, and the main point is, Ishanah will be tanking Socrethar.\
Socrethar will cast a \"fireball\" spell which is an AoE, avoid this by attacking it from behind or ranged. Also a \"Shadowbolt Volley\" but this can be interrupted, and you better interrupt it if you dun have a healer in group.\
\
Ishanah is an uber tank and she can heal herself, there are more than one way to do this without a full group - \
\
1. A warrior taunts Socrethar with shield wall when Ishanah is about to die. So she will have time to heal back to about 80%.\
\
2. Shaman lays Earth Elemental Totem, same function as a warrior, being a soap :p\
\
3. Warlock's banish.\
\
afterall, it's a DPS fight.\
\
One more point to add in, Scyers have the same quest on killing Socrethar, which they will have an item to weaken Socrethar(damage done lowered by 3/4 & damage taken increased by 400%).\
Combining the Aldor NPCs with Scryers' weakening buff.\
You can certainly auto-attack on Socrethar and go for a sleep.. lol",

We got to the place and the NPC's weren't moving and one guy said if we pulled a mob to the NPC's and had the NPCs go to the boss then it starts, well it did! The NPCs died very quickly beacuse we were unable to attack but as soon as they died, we could. And I usually get 1600 backstabs, but on him I was getting 6k backstabs, this guy went down so fast so just pull a mob up to the npcs, have the npcs kill the mob near the bosses and the event works out.

We waited a good 20 minutes after the friendly NPCs were killed by Socrethar and Kaylaan was still spawned in his defeated kneeling position.

    "10585154578101545782007/09/18 08:23:49bas3this is how I got the displacer\
\
since you are going to need the backpack anyway (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10583), just rush to place where the backpack is, die there and ressurect in the corner. Kill the mob guarding his corpse (use a healing pot if needed) and after he is dead drink/eat to regain health and mana. Now kill the two guards at the exit. Now you can safely pull two fast running tinkers. When you got the displacer the easiest way to get out is use your hearthstone (if it's on cooldown you can just die and spirit rez). After that, getting to the ledge is much easier. Wait just outside the first entrance till the fire elemental patrol passed, then go in and kill mobs till you reached the end of the bridge; there jump down.",

\
On your way in, jump off the path as soon as you see green water. You can walk between some stone blocks and end up behind the ritual circle. You don't need to fight any of the summoners. Just summon the elemental, he kills the summoners instantly, you solo one level 69 mob (5 seconds) and you're done.",
    "105853876440387642007/02/19 15:32:58aimoneAll of the information posted so far is true but just to clear up one thing about the respawn rate...\
\
When you get to the bottom of the summoning chamber, there are 3 normal summoners with relatively low health which are easy to dispatch, then there is the named Summoner Skartax who will continually summon the Infernal Souls which walk up out of the green water, around the corner and are joined by two of the Deathforge Tinkerer's (they spawn just as the infernal spawns.) The group of three will start patrolling around. The spawn rate for this seems to be around 3-5 minutes, I had the same problem on my mage where I would rest after killing the initial guards/patrol, then this mob of 3 would keep reappearing after dispatching them and I had finished resting.\
\
I suggest killing the patrol as quickly as possible (don't rest even if you have to) and moving down and standing behind the summoners in the chamber (there is a small amount of space there.) After that take down the rest of them. Once you kill Summoner Skartax the Infernal Oversoul will spawn which you need to kill to complete the quest, it was no issue as a frost mage.\
\
As for the disrupting from the ledge trick I'm not sure, I think clearing down to the bottom is the best solution. The summoners seemed to be on a ~5 minute cooldown too, so it would make a good farming spot seeming as they are relatively weak.",

    "11031157880501578802007/09/24 23:04:32SahrishAs of 2.1, there is a bug involving swapping your Violet Signet for a second time, given that you are alternating between three types of signets (which is entirely possible if you are a Druid, Shaman, Paladin, or clicked the wrong ring when you were first given a choice): if this is the second time you swap your Signet type, the game will think you currently have the ring that you originally picked when you hit Friendly reputation. This will cause you to get the wrong quest, which will ask for you to return that original, first ring, and not the one you currently have - so you can't swap your ring.\
\
For example (as in my case), if a character picks the Archmage ring, then later wants to switch to the Restorer ring, and later wants the Protector ring, they will be stuck with the Restorer ring, because Archmage Leryda will be asking for you to turn in the Archmage ring that does not exist.\
\
There is a simple fix to this, however - destroy your current ring, and talk to Archmage Leryda, and she will restore your first ring. This is verified by GMs; if you'd rather see for yourself, and you don't mind the four hour wait you can open a ticket and ask them yourselves.\

If you are patient and wait for him, you can pull the fell reaver to the right into a pack of elite mobs. They'll kill it for ya. If you're alliance, they're Thrallmar guards, so you will most likely die. If you can have a friend do the pull and you stay alive, that's fine. Or you can have an SS or whatever so you can complete the quest after the guards kill the fel reaver.",

Instead of waiting on the east side of the group of elites and running the Fel Reaver into them yourself you can go stand next to the Thrallmar wall on the west side of the elites and use your pet instead.  Once you're standing near the wall use Eyes of the Beast and run your pet out past the elites to where the Fel Reaver paths by.  As it comes close, aggro it and run your pet into the group of elites.  Once your pet gets to them they will AE it and with the Fel Reaver already chasing it will get AE'd as well.  The pet will die pretty quickly and the entire pack will start heading for you but you can just FD and then watch the show.",

Fel Reaver used his Thunder Clap and aggroed the orcs.  Big and stupid.  Used my Shield Wall to lower damage and took off to lose aggro.  Aggro stayed on Fel Reaver.  Waited for the death of Fel Reaver and went to fetch my key.  Every time I got close to Fel Reaver I was stunned by picking up aggro, but I did manage to make the key.  As it was said before, the big deal was to get some of the elites to aggro onto Fel Reaver or they both reset.\

It would appear that  you need to run right into the Elites, not just by them enough for their health bar to show. Also note that when you walk into the corpse of the FR to fire the key mold you do enter combat for a short time. This is not the Elites aggroing you(hopefully) but the intense heat of the FR's fel fire core.  Ouch!!\

But then I realized that the quest didn't need me to kill him, so I just went for his body and used the item while standing on it, and got the quest completed.\

So there you have it. You don't need to actually kill the Fel Reaver, if you see his body just stand on it and use the item.",

Since the Fel Reaver disapeared very quickly, I had to do it a second time and this time used my Boomerang (there is a use for it!) and walked through the group then shook them off as the fel reaver went to town on them.  The best path is once you run into the group head for the road and on the other side.  It is usually void of mobs and allows you some running space down the road to loose aggro of the mobs you picked up.  After that, a quick few heals and I was able to walk right behind the Fel Reaver and wait for him to fall.  Gotta get the key made quick otherwise his body does disappear quickly.",

\
Upon starting the event in the Gauntlet of Flame (correct me if that's not the right name of the place), with the boss and the two archers at the end, you will receive a 50 minute [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=39288]debuff[/url], indicating how long you have to complete the quest. (very similar to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=27861]The Baron's Ultimatum[/url] in [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=2017]Stratholme[/url]) Even though the debuff will be gone if you die, this does not mean that the quest failed.\
\
In order to complete the quest you need to engage the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=17301]Shattered Hand Executioner[/url], who will be located behind [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=16808]Kargath Bladefist[/url]. While of course you have to kill the Executioner, it is possible to engage him with one second left on the debuff, kill him when the debuff has already faded and still complete the quest.\
\
As stated in other posts, it is not possible to skip [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=16809]Warbringer O'mrogg[/url] or Kargath (by off-tanking him).\
\
While a timer of 50 minutes seems harsh for completing the (rest of the) instance, it allowed our party, consisting of two rogues, one feral druid, one holy and one shadow priest, for several deaths and a complete wipe.\

\
The Black Temple attunement starts at The Altar of the Sha'tar for Aldors, and the Sanctum of the Sun for Scryers. Both are in Shadowmoon Valley.\
\
Aldors start attunement from Anchorite Ceyla (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21402) at the Altar of Sha'tar in Shadowmoon Valley:\

4. [Sc] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10686 [70] The Warden's Cage\
\
After that, the chain comes together for Aldor and Scryer.\
\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10622 [70] Proof of Allegiance\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10628 [70] Akama\
7. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10705 [70] Seer Udalo\
\
Seer Udalo is found in the Arcatraz (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3846) just before the last boss.\
\
8. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10706 [70] A Mysterious Portent\
9. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10707 [70] The Ata'mal Terrace\
10. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10708 [70] Akama's Promise\
\
After you finish this chain, you get to pick from some rewards and the chain seems like it ends. It continues however, inside Serpentshrine Cavern (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3607) from an NPC called Seer Olum (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22820) who you can speak with after killing Fathom-Lord Karathress. He starts the next part of the Black Temple Chain by offering the quest:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10944 [70] The Secret Compromised\
For this quest you just return to Akama.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10946 [70] Ruse of the Ashtongue\
In this quest, you must use the costume Akama provides, and kill A'lar in Tempest Keep: The Eye while wearing the Ashtongue Cowl. Attunement for The Eye is a whole different chain.\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10947 [70] An Artifact From the Past\
In this, you need to gain access to The Battle of Mount Hyjal in Caverns of Time, and slay the first boss, Rage Winterchill. Attunement for this involves killing Lady Vashj and Kael'Thas Sunstrider.\
4. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10948 [70] The Hostage Soul\
For this you must speak with A'dal in Shattrath city.\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10949 [70] Entry into the Black Temple\
For this, just speak with the naaru Xi'ri in front of Black Temple.\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10985 [70] A Distraction for Akama\
Unknown what this quest asks of you, most likely you need to defend Xi'ri and make your way into Black Temple. At the end, you become attuned to enter and are granted The Medallion of Karabor (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32649)\
\
At this point, you are attuned and can enter Black Temple, although the chain continues and you can soon upgrade your medallion. It continues with:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10958 [70] Seek Out the Ashtongue\
You just need to find Seer Kanai (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=23158) inside Black Temple.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10957 [70] Redemption of the Ashtongue\
This involves entering Black Temple, and killing the boss the Shade of Akama (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22841).\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10959 [70] The Fall of the Betrayer\
After killing the Shade of Akama and returning to Seer Kanai, he asks one last thing of you. Kill Illidan The Betrayer. After doing so, you are granted the Blessed Medallion of Karabor, an upgraded version of your original medallion, and allows teleportation to the Black Temple.",

\
Terokk is a giant, ghostly arrakoa, and he has quite a lot of health. You will need a 5 man group with a tank and at least one healer with a considerable mana pool. \
\
During the fight, Terokk will become immune to all damage, at which point the tank will need to drag him to one of the four purple crystals around the edge of the green runic circle from which you summon him. This will shatter his immunity, at which point your group can carry on attacking him. Apart from that, it's a simple tank and spank fight.\
\
Terokk drops a BoP blue like each of the four named mobs you summoned during the 'Adversarial Blood' part of the chain. He dropped a blue 1h mace for my group with strangely enough, both +damage and healing and +healing on it, as seperate stats.\
\
Upon finishing the quest to destroy Terokk, you get a choice from four rewards. \

You first have to grind 6 dusts off of the (currently horribly overfarmed) living Arakkoa with their 25%ish droprate. Then you've to gobble the potion down, grind scrolls (~75% droprate) from the ghosts (that commonly zerg in groups of 3, heal eachother with unlimited mana, etc), until you a) get ganked and lose your potion, b) get zerged and lose your potion, c) get respawns while fighting and lose your potion. Then you have to grind 6 more dusts, and repeat the steps above. All in all, if your server is ganky, innumerable hours of \"exciting new solo content fun\". Oh, yeah, and that's provided you don't get ganked at the actual summoning, in which case you lose the 10 scrolls and have to go grind more. \

    "1107211444731880712007/07/02 13:16:19modsquadThe best way to farm the scrolls is in a group of 2 or more people. If you can get a healer or a class that can heal (feral druid) grinding out the scrolls gets MUCH easier. Just have one person that can DPS drink the potion while the other just heals & keeps the regular non-spirit mobs off the DPS. You will kill them faster, and only use up 1 pot per farm & be a lot less likely to get killed & waste a pot. I put on some druid healing gear I have stashed & healed for a rogue as a feral spec'd druid & it went great. The scrolls are lootable by people that DO NOT drink the pot that are also in the team so you can either just let the loot swap normally or put it on free for all & just take turns looting scrolls....or just have a designated scroll collector that will do all the summoning.",

    "110721176142701176142007/07/08 19:05:28KalakaEntire quest 2manned by a dark pact/ruin warlock and holy paladin. Imp was used, warlock did the tanking. You require 10 scrolls per boss per person (the two of us required a total of 80 time lost scrolls). We got 10 scrolls per 15 minutes, so 8 elixirs were needed (48 shadow dust). Only warlock used shadow elixirs (healers donât need to see undead to loot them). Took about half an hour for the shadow dust, and another 2 and a half hours of farming scrolls/killing bosses. When farming scrolls, itâs best to do a boss in between each elixir to allow for respawns.\
\
All bosses are immune to fear/stun/etc. After summoned, you have about 5 seconds before they aggro. They each have special abilities.\
\
Karrog â Approx. 73,000 hp. Hits for about 1900-2500 on cloth. âFixatesâ on a target, drastically reducing his move speed and increasing his damage to about 5500 on cloth. When he fixates, just kite and damage him, no healing should be needed if you just run (he walks REALLY slow).\
\
Gezzarak the Huntress â Approx. 59,000 hp. Hits for about 1500 on cloth. Casts âwarped armorâ debuff, reduces armor to 0. Will âfocusâ on a target, then warp to them, dropping aggro.\
\
Darkscreecher Akkarai â Approx 47,000 hp. Does a frostbolt attack, 2.5 second cast, for around 1000 frost damage. Every few frostbolts, he will do a fire blast for around 1600 fire damage. Will also summon adds around every 20 seconds. They come 3 at a time, they are birds that donât hit for much, have about 5000 hp. The pally gathered them up while the warlock burned Akkarai down, then after he died the birds were killed with seed of corruption (only needed 4).\
\
Vakkiz the Windrager â Approx. 59,000 hp. Hits for about 1500 on cloth. Does a chain lightning with around 2000 initial damage for the first 50%. At 50% hp he switches to a bone form, and begins to cast âBone Sprayâ. Initially hits cloth for around 500. Each time he attacks, it adds a stack to a debuff he puts on you which increases damage taken by 5% per stack. He casts this around every 2 seconds. Save all your cooldowns for 50%.\
\
Each boss will drop 1 of their quest item that gets rolled on. They also each drop 1 BoP blue item with a random enchant on it. Despite WoWheadâs info, their quest item is a 100% drop (people who donât need the quest that kill the bosses get no drop, which alters WoWheadâs information).",

It's the only reason I'm going to put the time and effort into this, though this is also due in part to the fact that I only get the dusts from mobs I kill everyday escorting the Skyguard Prisoner. :P Every time I get enough for a potion, I pop it and get as many scrolls as I can, then repeat when I get enough dusts for another potion.\

    "106367561510756152007/04/30 16:24:36seyekJust wanted to clarify how this quest works:\
\
Around the Hand of Guldan, there is a road visible from your map that completely circles it. On this road, 3 ghosts ride in a group at 160% speed in a counter-clockwise fashion. So, the best method to find them would be to follow the road in a clockwise direction to head them off. They are 3 non-elite mobs. However, you will get your Truncheon from the first kill. So, if you cannot normally take on 3 at once, attack and kill at least one, then run from the others (preferably on the road so you don't aggro more mobs) after slowing them.  After a short period of running, the mobs chasing you will stand still and evade. Then, you are free to go back and loot your Truncheon. Like all ghosts, hunter traps don't affect them.",

If your friends fails to accept simply wait, after a while you will free some small elementals and then make sure your friends are ready to accept the quest, she will then bug and go back to the start, and start walking to free the elementals... again.

Right now Blizzard's response to this item being totally inconsistent with all other item choices in the game is that you can grind you way to exalted and then make the switch.  It was easier for them to make you grind for months than to make this choice consistent with every other item choice in the game.",

    "108816522810652282007/04/10 22:28:23JaylenThe respawn rate isn't too much different than on the surface, but perhaps it was fixed to the rate I am reporting currently.  Many early reports on respawn were due to the rate being higher than intended to make up for the high quantity of people entering the zones all at once at the very beginning.  Currently a single person can clear out a wing of the Shadow Tomb, loot and be about halfway through the other side before the first respawn begins appearing.  So I guess it is quick, but not insanely fast.\
\
It is the high number, normal for Terrokkar, mob per foot ratio combined with an annoyingly high agro range that makes this section aggravating.  I didn't die once, but I was a pet class.  When one mobs agros there is usually a second, so unless you have a pet another person or CC will be very helpful.\
\
Returning the respawn rate, I did notice that the Interrogator guarding the escort mission NPC did respawn three times before the guards outside the room respawned.  She respawned a fourth time as I was trying to line up a pull on a single guard that had respawned outside the doorways.  Plus I noticed she tended to pass me and make a bee-line to assist the mob my pet was attacking half a room away.  I will try to remember to test her again late to see if this was a lone bug or working as intended.",

Start in bear form, if you can time your HoTs so you can get them on beforehand, do so, but otherwise get in Bear as soon as possible. When the event starts pull the colossal into the hole with you and place your back against the big red crystal. Keep Demoralizing Roar up at all times, and of course Faerie Fire(Feral) makes this easier as well. Keep your [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=25787]Charm of Alacrity[/url] on cooldown.\
\
When you are just fighting the colossal, just keep Mauling, using Mangle when it's up.\
\
When he summons his friends, use Demoralizing Roar and just keep Swiping repeatedly. This gives you the bonus Rage from critting on more than one mob, as well as gives you more chances to crit to proc your Improved Leader of the Pack.\
\
When you are first down to about half health, pop your Enrage+Frenzied Regen and just auto-hit for it's duration. When he starts knocking your health down other times, you're going to have to carefully time your Bashes, pop out, Barkskin and heal up as fast as possible. If he becomes unstunned his knockback will interrupt your casting.\

sorry unless you are a very well geared rogue it could be hard since sap wont work here.\
\
if everyone in your party has already burned the houses you STILL NEED to burn them otherwise Thrall will give you the quest but not let you escort\
\
Starting the quest\
burn the houses, pretty simple its a four pack just kill them watch out for pats. once you have bombed all 5 houses a boss will will spawn near the stairs to go back up. easy fight tank it and spank it. hes got a whirlwind that does quite a bit of damage so back up when he starts that only have tank attack.\
\
after that there is a four pack a pat (that usually comes with the four pack) then a final four pack once u have cleared all of that you can go DOWN (dont go up the stairs) into the cellar. have every1 accept the quest (dont worry he wont start going until you say something like 'lets go, we're ready'\
\
buff up\
make sure every1 will not have to leave for the next 1-2.5 hours this is a very intense quest and you cannot have breaks except inbetween parts.\
make sure every1 has the BEST water/food even if you dont have a mage get the 7.5k mana/health stuff  everyone should have at least 10 of each (unless warrior then 20 food) hand out healthstones if you have a lock as well as a soulstone make sure every1  has some pots also.\
\
During the fights:\
\
    * if person with soulstone dies USE IT RIGHT AWAY\
    * if thrall dies you have to start the whole escort over again so make sure he is ALWAYS above 70% health\
    * eat/drink RIGHT AFTER each mob he RUNS to the next so you must keep full mana/health even if u have 90% of each DRINK AND EAT!!\
\
Special abilities:\
\
    * Wardens-NEED to be killed/sheeped first they will heal about 50+% of any1's health while they are up have a rogue/something that can make sure they dont finish that heal if they heal that can be the difference between clearing and wiping\
    * Mages- they will sheep you, hit pretty hard\
    * Veterans-hit pretty hard, not as much need to take down first\
    * range guys- (im not sure their name but it will have range i think in the name) hit 900-1.5k with their gun be carefull\
\
Part one:\
this is walking him out of the castle and just out of durndholde.\
there is a 4 pack right outside the building\
after that he will run to another 4 pack down the hill\
after that another four pack right before the bridge\
and finally a four pack on the other side of the bridge.\
\
once u have killed all four you meet your second boss. once again not sure his name i did this a few days ago. but he comes with 1  healer and 1-2 other guys..\
this guy also heals himself/his buddies\
so put the tank on him keep heals on tank and kill adds\
i as a warlock just feared the healer around and doted him till he was dead while the other 2 were killed by my group.\
once they are dead make sure u have a rogue/mage/priest or some1 stopping his heals. pretty easy fight.\
\
after you kill him you get a little break take this time to rebuff pass out more food/water/pots/healthstones/soulstones whatever you need\
once you are ready time for part 2...\
\
Part 2\
once you are ready talk to him and he will get on the mount of the boss u just killed and you'll be off this part is quite easy just 2 mobs while ur on the road riding to tarren mill. if u can try and pull the first mob off the road a little and you will skip the second mob. these mobs are yellow twords us but Thrall will attack them.. after a little bit of riding you will stop at tarren mill to get to part 3...",

pretty much like part 1 a few mobs. just be always drinking/eating in between mobs you will only have to kill 3 mobs, one in the stable one in the church and one in the house. after the house Thrall finds this girl and you have to save her by killing the final boss.. buff up and get ready for the final boss. no need for water but make sure EVERY1 one has bandages/pots\

part 4\
The final boss. once again dont know his name damn that would be helpfull i'm going to finish this quest again so i'll edit it with bosses names.\
\
okay this guy has 3 or 4 waves of mobs you must kill.. cannot be sheeped but can be feared. these mobs put a weird Debuff on you it gives u +50% you get healed but also +50% damage u take. its a curse so mages should be looking to decurse it. if you dont have a mage just avoid damage while you have it its about a 1 min buff. while you have it and your not being attacked bandage they will heal  you +50% which is nice. after these mobs he will come. make sure to conserve your mana/health during these mobs cuz the boss comes DIRECTLY after.\
\
boss..\
pretty simple tank it and spank it\
has a debuff he puts on people as far as i know it just decreases your speed by like 90% or something he hits pretty hard so be careful\

I did just great in there. Key for group was Healer, MT & Marker (ie: the person that puts the little skulls and diamonds on the mobs).\
\
I was able to gain stealth through out the waves of fights, Shadowstep, Ambush, Kidneyshot, Kick, Blind, Vanish and start all over again. Worked just great. MT held agro and the mobs just got punished with my Eviscerate. If an add went to Healer, I ran after it, used blind (you don't loose combo points doing this) and went right back to killing the Skull. That gave the MT time to re-agro the loose add. Easy and NO problems. And we didn't wipe once.\
\
Believe me. My gear is not at all that great. But I didn't agro except at my first hit (Ambush) and a few times with Eviscerate. But; That's why Rogues have Feint ->> to loose the agro.  \
\
So you are very wrong in saying a Rogue is no use because we can't Sap during combat; and or that we need to be \"well geared\". We have [b]a LOT[/b] (emphasis on [url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/a%20lot]A LOT[/url]) of other Crowd Control even during a fight.

If you've ever been ganked by a Rogue, you know that they are very affective.)\

\
This is the third of three mini boss fights in this quest, each involving a different aspect of your druid abilities. (This particular fight involves your ability to root and cast spells)\
\
Click the statue and the NPC will spawn directly in front, like with the other you will have a few seconds to back up and prepare your roots and initial abolish poison. Remember that your abolish poison ticks and dispells future poisons, so keep that in mind you can completely avoid  the viper sting he throws at you. He occasionally curses you so be aware of that too.\
\
DO NOT attempt to use melee combat, and take advantage of barksin. Preempt your roots to make sure that he doesnt come within melee range, and use your wrath/moonfire to burn him down as quickly as possible. They do almost 400% damage (all your druid spells).",

Starfires hit for under 4k, he resists roots far too often, and my mana pool was under 6k.  After about 10 attempts, I managed to get him down, but it was as much luck as anything else.  People in my situation should either bring a friend, gear up a little first, or be prepared to lose to the random number generator a lot (i.e. 2 root resists in a row).",

Small problem; if you take this route, keep in mind that mage arcane spells cast very fast and damage breaks the roots.

\
If you are Balance spec, don't use Moonkin form though. You'll need to decurse and de-poison yourself a few times.\
\
And don't use Wrath. Starfire and Moonfire are the way to go.",

\
I recommend using Starfire over Wrath for this encounter since the less-frequent hits give you a lesser chance to break your roots.  Nature's Grasp also comes in handy.",

I had a hard time my first attempt - he drained all my mana and my roots were not sticky long enough. His melee hits are exceptionally heavy.\
\
I ended up getting a resto druid pal (who is nearing his 5k gold) to help just in case I needed a mid-cast roots or an abolish poison. Went down quickly!",

Is to use the netherwing ally trinket and summon him while fighting, it does very respectable damage and can take some hits while you nuke if  you want it to.\

Even with some healing gear giving 7500 mana, and with heals from the healadin, it didn't take long to get killed. My roots would only hold for a couple of seconds. No question I was rusty casting spells, and I didn't get far enough away from the mob so I could cast roots while it ran to me. \
\
But I simply lacked the patience to get the technique down, so I switched to tanking gear (14K HP, 24K armor) and slowly, ever so slowly, beat the mob down. It wasn't a strain so much as it took time; each mangle would only reduce the mob's health by 1%. The healadin had to pot a couple of times, but my health never even went down to 50%. Just clear the area of mobs and fight the npc right at the statue.",

    "1078170281170702812007/04/20 23:04:44benjiFMManaged to 3-man the quest after 2 tries.\
Setup was Prot Warrior, Holy Priest and Rogue. Remember to Shadow Resist Buff.\
\
First Wave\
Mixed spawn of melee mobs that comes in 2 forms, Humans and Demon forms. Basically tank ran in and grab aggro while healer waits till tank has a sunder on each mob. They don't hit too hard. Meanwhile the rogue would start peeling off the Demonkins first as we noticed they have about 2k less HP then the humanoid version and they're pretty big so we wanted to get better vision as well. Once ya down to the last mob, let healer regen back mana before killing it to trigger the second wave.\
\
Second Wave\
This is the wave that gave us the most problems. Spawns 2 x Demons that does a mean mind flay and fears. Key to this fight is to interupt as many mind flays as possible, they can be stunned so thats a huge plus. Rogue would Kick / Kidney Shot / gorge, while warrior Concussion Blows / shield bash. Also to note, as we were 3 manning it, the warrior tanked them similiarly to Onyxia style, getting berzerker rage up as often as possible to avoid fear. If warrior is feared, priest would get all the aggro, just keep healing as the fears don't last too long. Concentrate DPS and take one down asap, then move on to the other. Don't use them to regen mana, as a badly time fear could be a wipe. Quickly move on to the third wave.\
\
Third Wave\
4 x humanoid caster style that has quite a good amount of HP and casts FlameStrike for about 2k damage. For this, we got priest to stand in middle while the warrior would tank 3 of them on one side of the priest while the rogue tanked the 4th one on the other side of the priest. Basically we wanted all of us to spread out to avoid FS. Simple fight, rogue quickly kill his while warrior tanks the 3, when you guys see the casting animation, simply just move away from where u're standing as that would be the FS location. Key to this is to not let priest aggro and move out of FS range when ya see the casting animation. Once rogue is done with his, just join the warrior and finish up the remainder.\
\
Last Boss\
Cake.. Has a spell reflect that looks like a counterspell animation, and cast a 1k++ shadow damage knockback. Tank him in the middle, when he casts knockback, we just run out of range.. quite alot of HP, classic tank and spank..\
\
Notes\
Basically as long as priest does not get aggro and warrior is comfortable with multi tanking, 3 manning is very possible. Priest used alot of binding heals for the fight and had pretty decend mana per second to last the waves. Ideally for all the waves except the second one, possible to tank the last mob while healer gets back mana.",
    "107814118710411872007/02/23 16:15:02JaixoDid this quest with \
Feral druid (healing)\
Rogue\
Mage\
Arms warrior\
and hunter\
\
Had a few probs with the healing, our rogue died in the 2nd wave, but got combatressed before the boss.. Would've been much easier if I was healing specced, but we managed the Q with some kiting during 3rd wave.",
    "1078127197540271972007/01/29 14:13:20SledeauThis is easy as long as you have the right group make up, everyone's on the ball, know what to do, and have at least five rather than four. I did this with a feral druid tank, arms warrior tank, tree druid, enhancement shaman healer, and a warlock. I really reccomend having at least two tanks and two healers for this. It might be doable with one healer if everyone plays smart. The warlock was also nice for the first wave because he could enslave one of the demons.\
\
The first wave is pretty simple. A bunch of demons and blood elves spawn and you basically take them down. As far as I know they are not CC'able, with exception to enslave.\
\
The second wave is two eyes which do a mean mind flay. Interrupt them when they do that as soon as possible to help save the healer's mana.\
\
The third wave has four fire lords which are blood elf npc's who have a ton of hp and cast flamestrike. This is the fight you have to be on the ball on. It is preferable to have each tank on two of the npc's. Whenever one of the npc's start to cast flame strike, the tank on them and any melee DPS on them need to MOVE. This is pretty universal for any flamestriking mob, but since flamestrike is a ground target spell, its possible to dodge it if you get out of its area of effect (the center of its target when it starts casting, the area of the effect will not follow the person if they move after the cast begins) before it finishes casting. If everyone can dodge the flame strikes, this wave is fairly easy.\
\
The last wave, the final boss is a simple straight up fight. He will occasionally do an ae damage/knockback, this is another one that can be dodged by moving away when he does it. The casting animation looks like he's casting a shadow spell, so its fairly easy to spot. If you managed to do the third wave though, this one should be no problem, even if you eat the ae's from the boss.\
\
Enjoy your blue ring reward and flashy new tabard.",
    "107814087940408792007/02/23 02:14:24ezekialOn a side note. After the first wave if you have a warlock in your group they can enslave one of the demons.

The hardest group was the second wave and it took us a couple tries to get it. When we got to the third we had our druid tank all of them while our prot warrior pull one off at a time and the two warriors killed it.",
    "1078115693011329952007/09/23 01:59:36ThymusIt can easily be done by four people.  Did it a moment ago with a Fury Warrior (dual wielding) an Arms Warrior, a Holy Priest, and an Affliction Warlock (me).\
\
First group was cake, I just spammed Seed of Corruption and they dropped like flies.  I don't think they have more than 7000 health.\
\
Second group was a lot harder if you try and focus fire.  So each warrior was one and I dotted both and drained them.  If you try and focus the priest WILL die.  (happened the first try).\
\
The third group we managed without the priest but the arms warrior died.  I again spammed Seed of Corruption and counted on them to keep aggro and keep me up.  Which they mostly did.\
\
The boss is pretty easy but keep your back to the wall.  He does his knockback and could possibly knock you into the watchers.  We were too lazy to kill the four again and it turned out is wasn't necessary.\
\
Easy for about a 30g reward and a stylish tabard.",
    "107815117710511772007/03/14 16:27:41BludshartA well balanced 5-man group can beat this if you know what to expect. We had a warrior tank, a priest, a rogue (me), a hunter and a mage. \
\
We had trouble with people lagging when the first group spawned, especially if there was alot of demons.  We all mounted up on our flying mounts, minus the tank, for the beginning. When the tank had aggro, we picked them off one by one. They are actually fairly soft for elites.\
\
Next wave, we had the tank stay in the middle, while we went to the North and south sides, since the Eyes spawn east and west.  Just keep them interupted during the \"focused mind burst\" and you should be fine.\
\
The third wave can be CC'd, so we took all the appropriate measures, and killed one at a time.\
\
The last guy is a simple tank and spank fight.  Overall, just remember to drink in between fights, try to tank them towards the huge crystal in case of fears, and focus fire ftw.",

    "10781112270101122702007/06/28 09:28:17KeilunNearly 2 manned this quest. Feral Druid, Holy Priest. A Holy Pally jumped in on the 2nd wave and helped with some heals. After that though, it went smoothly.\
\
Wave 1\
\
Any decently geared tank won't take much damage and can tank all of them. While there was a lot of them they were hitting for about 50dmg on the druid. Hit me (the priest) for about 200dmg. It probably actually worked out better that it was just the druid DPSing as a tank to make it easier to hold everything. It's a given that a tank that can multitank well is pretty essential.\
\
Wave 2\
\
This is the toughest part. Being unable to mitigate the wide range of magic damage that these two Eyes put out makes it a healing intensive part of the fight. I went through a mana pot, my shadowfiend, trinkets and inner focus. On our successful attempt, we brought them down to 10% before I was out of mana. The innervate would have come but I died.\
\
Holy pally came in at that point and picked up the heals which gave the druid enough time to battle rez me.\
\
Wave 3\
\
Simple fight. Tank needs to watch out for the flame strikes, especially with that curse debuff that adds 50% fire damage. Can be deadly if more than one flamestrike is being cast and lands. Healing wise, this wasn't very intensive either except for the odd flamestrike that landed. I managed to rebuff myself and regen from 0 mana to full during this wave.\
\
Boss\
\
Straight forward tank and spank as previously mentioned. Has a good chunk of HP, and hits a bit harder. Some horde swung by waiting for their turn to do this (didn't gank us thankfully!) and helped add some DPS.\
\
Gear-wise, the druid is in mostly blues (heavy clefthoof set), a couple epics from heroics and Earthwarden. Me the priest, mostly heroic epics (3) and the rest just top blues from the normal instances.",

=========================================================\
\
[b]Quest Notes[/b]: The quest giver gives you a potion of charges called âNavuudâs Concotionâ (Looks like a jar of water ((yes blue)) with a cap on top)  You drink this, and it gives you a 1 hour buff (that disappears when you die, but no fear, Its reusable as much as you like, unlimited charges).\
\
You go out and find the parental unit of these globules, (Seeping Sludges, and Void Wastes) and engage in a fightâ¦ [b]MAKE SURE THE POTION BUFF IS ON[/b]!  Shortly after the engagement, the parental sludge/waste bursts into a ton of tiny guys that run around like crazy.  You are required to kill them.  As a Mage, 2 arcane explosions (maybe 3 depending on your spec) should kill the little ones.  Each parental unit explodes in to approximately 6-10 little guys.  Youâre required to kill 30 of each kind to complete the quest.  Simple in Theory.\
\
[small][i]Having a buff like Thorns, Molten Armor, Retaliation, etc that causes damage when youâre hit makes life A LOT easier downing the little ones.[/i][/small]\
\
=========================================================\
\
[b]Alliance Watch[/b]: MODERATE â Many quests in this area for the Consortium faction. I ran into a few, all questing, so they didnât bother me.  They also have quests in this area, so odds of attack are low, but hey, who can predict human nature.\
[b]Quest Rank of Ease[/b]: Average â AOE Class has it the easiest, but with the Agro in the area and the fairly quick respawn rate, this isnât necessarily an easy task.\

If you have drunk the electro potion, the sludge/.waste will break up into 8-12 globs after 1-3 hits.  As a warlock I broke it down at a distance, and simply wanded the globs one at a time.\

Hpwever. I had two mobs respawn on top of me, and kill me at 29/30 globs killed - of course - immune to fear!!  When I went back to the quest giver there was no option to receive another electro potion.  So it seems i will have to drop the quest and redo from the beginning to finish it.  Bummer.",

\
In the room with the sentinal, there are also two larvae-work things. They're non-elite and can be killed quite easily. You can pull them from the corner without aggroing the sentinal.\
\
In the Voidwalker (VW) room there are 3 mobs to worry about. The first is a fleshling beast. He's non-elite, just pull him into the sentinal room and kill him. The second mob that poses an issue is a VW that patrols from the center of the room to the doorway of the sentinal room. Third, there is another VW that patrols from the center of the room to the arcane container. These patrols are random, but every once in a while they do match up. The weakness in the room is when they are both in the middle of the room.\
\
First, open the arcane container. If you have good timing and a little luck, you can stealth as the container opens and the keeper spawns. If not, just vanish. After the keeper spawns, the trick is to wait until both the VWs are in the center of the room. Distract them there to ensure they stay in the middle for a few extra seconds. Next, run over to the keeper and gun/bow/throw pull him. Have him follow you back to the sentinal room, and kill him there.\
\
This way you don't have to deal with voidwalkers, and you can take your time on the keeper.",

\
Don't forget to ask people on your friend or guild list (at least) if they are also in need of the key fragment you're going for. It's much more efficient to go in as a group and wreck up the joint than it is to cunningly solo up to them and miss out on four other people you could run Karazhan with not having their fragments completed.",
    "983227916560279162007/01/30 20:56:13SinsweeperThere are three ways to go about doing this quest. \
\
First and most obvious, complete the instances. The fragment from Steamvault is at the bottom of the pond leading up to the Naga boss. The fragment from Arcatraz is on the right side of the room where the first boss (a voidwalker) is at. \
\
Second, you can \"borrow\" someoen's completed instances. Do a /who check on who's doing the instances and ask them if they can preserve the group after they've cleared it. Then, simply go in and acquire the fragments. \
\
Third, if you're a druid or a rogue, then you can actually solo (if u're a rogue) or duo (if u're a driud) this. Second fragment is straightforward, stealthing into the pond wouldn't be a problem at all if you had at least 1 point into Master of Deception/feral instinct. The third fragment from arcatraz is slightly more difficult. You need to go through a narrow tunnel before you reach the room with the fragment, and in that tunnel sits a mechanical bot that does an AoE lightning zap which hits all targets around him every 2 seconds. If you're a rogue, then turn on sprint and run through him, and vanish until AFTER you're well out of the range of his lightning (which is around 15 yards). If you're a druid, then you must have another rogue or druid to help you pull him away; note that, even if you are hit by his lightning, you won't get into combat, so just wait for prowl to cooldown after u get hit by the lightning, and run into the room.",

\
You'll need a soulstone from a warlock.\
\
Pop on tanking gear and go in defensive stance.\
\
Second, run as close as you can to the first mobs, pop an invisiblity potion and then use your nifty stopwatch, run around to the left (to avoid the stealth detecting giant mob) and get as close to the water as you can, by the time you are around there, your invisibility will be wearing off, so you must die between the hallway and the pack of 4 mobs there, make sure you can use the soulstone in a safe spot, because you'll need to be out of combat when you res up to use another invis pot.\
\
\
Once you res, use the next pot and jump to water.. open thing and kill mob.. get fragment.\
\
Of course it might be easier finding a group to just do this, since you have to wait 10 minutes to use the potion again, but meh, if you know a warlock that won't mind soulstoning you I guess it's worth it.",

When you enter the instance in the first room, kill the Underbog Overlord to the right. Go to the spot where he was standing and wade through the bushes. Kill the 2nd Overlord. After that go straight and you should see a little hill. Kill whatever mobs you need to get over the hill. Once you get there, there should be a large pond nearby.

\
buy some invis potions.  go into the instance as close to the first mobs as you can.  drink invis potion and run straight and then turn right at the pillar.  now this is the hard part (i'm an engineer so i had the rocket boots) the potion will be wearing off around that first pillar and you need to atleast make it into the water.  you can try to drop the earth elemental totem and put Earth shield on yourself.  or find some other trinket that will help you survive till you get in the water.  \
\
once in the water let them kill you and use reincarnation.  you can get back out of the water as long as you stay right at the edge so you can drink/eat.\

Just as invis is running out pop a invis potion and dive into the pool. The arcane container is at the bottom of the pool(20 meters down)",
    "98325533490553342007/03/22 11:00:47NirodhaI just soloed both these fragments and wanted to give some tips on the 3rd fragment (the one in arcatraz) It was much more involved then the steamvualt's second fragment.\
\
First have at least 350 lock picking or the arcatraz key.\
\
Once inside, there is a short hallway at the end of which there is a larger circular room with a fight going on. Fleshling style mobs are running to into the room opposite the side you entered on. Blood elves are killing them quickly. I moved to the side of the doorway the fleshlings are coming through then waited for the BE frontline to finish off one of the bigger black fleshlings then when the rest hug the narrow hallway's wall and move into the next room (with 5 ranks of MOD you practically have to touch hall mobs to pull aggro).\
\
The next room was my least favorite part. The first time through was a breeze cause i got lucky with the timing. After that I realized that the right side of the room (where the next hallway is) was where the fleshings for the first room were spawning. If they repop on you your sunk or have to use a vanish. Hugging the wall to the right when you enter the room gave me the best results. Enter the next hallway paying mind to those corpses on the floor (all BE corpses in here spawn fleshlings.. don't walk on them.\
\
After this short hallway, there will be a translucent ramp straight ahead and to your right. Hug a side of this ramp and head up it. It will straighten out towards the top then narrow to a small hallway. There is a sentinel on the left side of this hallway in its center. Be sprinting when you enter the hall and immediately after entering the hall use Cloak of Shadows. You should resist his laser.. if you donât... use vanish. Hug the right wall after exiting the hallway. The fragment container is on this wall. Move to the corner by the container then wait for the voidwalker patrol to move to the center of the room. I like every reasonable advantage when Iâm fighting an elite of my level so I did this.\
\
Drink Potions. If you have an agility and mongoose, DRINK THE MONGOOSE FIRST. If you drink agility pots first mongoose will override them. Take whatever else you likeâ¦ then keep either a health pot , armor pot or invulnerability pot handy for the fight. In short, buff up.\
\
When the voidwalker has patrolled away open the container. Put 5 combo points on the guardian then vanish. Wait 5 minutes for vanish to cool down ( I waited in the same corner as the guardian).\
\
Then the fight. When the voidwalker patrols away he pauses sometimes before he clears the wall (the wall to your right when you stand in the corner and face the guardian). He is still in aggro range here. Once he moves away, DPS the crap out of the guardian. Use all your cool downs but save evasion (unless you have prep) in case the voidwalker comes back earlier â¦ if it looks like you will kill the guardian before the voidwalker comes back go ahead and pop evasion too. Keep in mind the guardian can be stunned and poisoned too!\
\
Buffed, I had about 7k Hp and about the best gear you could quest by yourself plus a couple of instance drops. My armory profile is under the same name, Iâm convinced mace spec saved me. When I did kill him I had him and the voidwalker pounding on me and 44 health left D:\
\
Good luck. Also I recommend doing this fragment first so you can laugh at how easy the steam vault one is :D",

Varedis Must Be Stopped is the final part.  It's a 5-man group quest that sends you to the terrace outside the Black Temple to kill four elites: [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21178]Varedis[/url], [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21164]Netharel[/url], [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21168]Theras[/url] and [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21171]Alandien[/url].

Once they reach 49% they will cease their duel and aggro you. \
\
Extremely easy to kill them after that.\
\
If you have any sort of ability that puts you on their aggro list but doesn't do (enough) damage to aggro them off their sparring partner, cast it on them and just wait for their duel to finish.\
\
When one of the pair is low on HP and uses Evasion (\"Demon Hunter Supplicant begins intensely dodging incoming attacks\"), just switch to the other one. Once that one Evades, the buff should have worn off on the first one.",
    "105872914411272222007/02/01 20:47:02ClickCorrect. I went up the stairs and killed about two dozen for the drops. Thanks.",
    "105879562930956292007/06/01 21:14:20StrikeAfter all the above comments, if you still didn't figured out how to do this quest, I will give some advices for those melee classes. I'm a 70 rogue currently with some Kara gear, epic weapons and top-blue. And still after each pull I have like half of my life cut (full is 8.1k unbuffed).\
\
So, this quest might be of some difficult for those starting at 70 or not even a 70 yet. That's it:\
\
Start from the stairs and go pulling each 2 duelists. Wait until they get like 60% health and give him a ranged weapon shot. Then run farther you can and wait until they aggro you. I'm saying that because I got sometimes surprised by another 2 adds coming to me when the first 2 are about to die. I don't know if it's a bug but they don't call for help, just seems to aggro randomly by a incredible distance.\
\
Besides that, as said above, they pop evasion when in low life (about 20% or less). Try to stun as fast as you can, before they start to infinite dodge, or simple swap targets. And remeber... get the more far away from the other groups you can and the named elite, else you're pretty sure dead meat.\
\
Repeat this steps and you're done. (For me the drop rate was something like 25-30%. So have patience).",

\
-Skywing has 5,600 hit points and can defeat any of the regular enemies ON HIS OWN and be left at low HP.\
-Skywing regens all his lost hit points in a matter of seconds.\
-He also generates moderate threat and can serve as a tank if you are trying to conserve hit points or mana.\
-He can last for a short while against the boss.\
\
As a rogue fighting the boss, I blew all of my cooldowns. I had forgotten to bring healing pots so when I reached about 500 HP when the elite was almost dead I vanished and Skywing (who was at about 30% HP) took over the aggro. I stayed stealthed for a second or two and then cheap shotted the boss and finished him off while he was stunned.\

It was very risky but I realized that Skywing could be used to save your life on the final boss and to buy you time before him on easier enemies so that you can eat or mana regen.",

\
Confirmed.  However keep your quest log open, cause my quest tracker didnt say it was complete, but it did in my quest log.  Look for when skywing says \"Free at last from that horrible curse!  Thank you!  Please send word to Rilak the Redeemed that i am okay.  My mission lies in Skettis.  Terokk must be defeated.\"  At that point, the quest is over.  Dont do what i did and die trying to kill the elite.  \
\
Solo'd as a 65 MS warrior.  Also because you dont have to kill the elite, go completely defensive during the fight.  So for warriors id recommend a 1h and shield, and popping shield wall if you get low on health.  You can inturupt his chain lightning and his lightning cloud, but he will do an instant lightning/knockback attack every 10 seconds or so that does decent damage.  He is basically an elite version of the oracles you fight on your way up during this quest.  \
\
Oh yeah, that reminds me.  The oracles as well as the elite all have a knockback.  Make sure your back is to the tree.  First time i failed the quest cause they knocked me off the tree.  Skywings respawn if you die/fail is about 5min.",

However, as stated above, if all mobs are killed prior to jumping from platform A to B, Skywing will continue as intended.

Well, when I got to the place the elite spawns, there was still a non-elite left (It did not wait until we had killed them all to spawn) and so it was me and the bird against them both. I tried to kite the elite like someone else mentioned, but neither the elite nor Skywing would move. I ended up dying. =",
    "108983212550321252007/02/07 08:16:18IlliminHe is vulnerable to incapacitates and stuns. Interrupts are very useful as two of his nukes are potent and have 2 second cast times (chain lightning and lightning cloud.) His melee is fairly weak. He has a very powerful instant lightning nuke that he uses perhaps every 10-15 seconds. This is quite easily soloable by any class 65+ if you use consumables and abilities correctly. Use the line of sight of the tower you fight on to your advantage if you need to interrupt chain lightning. Do not let him beat on the bird for more than a few seconds. If he gets a cloud off, kite him (and thus the bird you're escorting) out from underneath it. On the way to him you will not fight more than two arrakoa at the same time.",

    "1089837291121365202007/02/16 23:37:23KaganarBy reading the posts above I thought this quest was hard -- it isn't. I managed to solo it as a level 65 shadow priest (that is, no shadowfiend) with full health and half mana at the end and no potions. I imagine other classes with at most health potions and/or bandages can do the same. Here's how:\
\
The elite at the end doesn't appear to have much of a physical attack and only chain lightning to supplement it. So, three key points:\
\
1. Clear the mobs on the final platform ASAP before Skywing summons the elite! You must be engaged in combat (that is, the mob is hitting you or Skywing) to prevent the summoning. The final platform itself after you jump down after Skywing and cross the bridge.\
\
2. The platform the elite mob spawns on has a center to it which is subject to line of sight. This is to your advantage. When the elite begins to cast chain lightning, run out of its line of sight. Stay out of light of sight until the elite's casting bar goes away. The cast time is about three seconds, so you've plenty of time. This prevents you from ever getting hit by chain lightning.\
\
3. Don't get knocked off. The knockback isn't very far, but it's enough to ensure that if you're near the edge, you've failed the quest.\
\
Good luck!",
    "10898200337302003372007/12/12 18:12:44cucmw5Also confirmed - clear the platform he would jump down to AHEAD of time, and the quest runs smoothly. Don't try to solo the last boss unless you're a high lvl. My 66 mage didn't fare so well, as Skywing doesn't tank very well.",
    "10898202964111837652007/12/17 16:35:26ataeginaquest is retarded.\

:(",
    "10898192541111837652007/11/28 02:14:41EyesIndeed, this quest is bugged.  After I jumped down from the platform and took out the mobs, I noticed that Skywing was simply fluttering in one spot.  Figuring that I could maybe continue it without him (and maybe kill the elite, as I have no idea if it spawns with Skywing or if it's already spawned), the escort quest simply failed after I walked a short ways away.\
\
If you see this quest and want to successfully complete it without forgetting that it even exists (or if you're simply a completionist like I am), my recommendation is to accept the quest, then run off.  It'll fail, but you'll have it in your quest log, so that will serve as a reminder to attempt the quest once more after it's fixed.",

\

    "10898193233411837652007/11/29 07:15:56Mag1tekI've found a workaround for this bug. Before starting the quest, head to the platform that Skywing jumps down to and kill the two mobs there. Then immediately head back to Skywing and start the quest so that those mobs don't respawn by the time Skywing makes his way to that point. \
\
It seems that so long as Skywing doesn't aggro anything immediately after making his jump, the quest should proceed normally.\
\
Here are directions to that platform if you haven't attempted the quest before: From where Skywing spawns, head up the slope past two guards and head to the first large tree structure. Enter it and head up the long spiral ramp to the first treetop platform. There will be three mobs and a signal fire up here. \
\
Go across the rope bridge to the connected treetop platform. From here, directly to your right and below this platform you should see another platform with two mobs on it; one standing still, another pacing along a short path. These are the mobs you need to kill. \
\
So long as they are not alive when Skywing jumps down to the platform, you should not encounter the bug that stops the quest.",

Regarding Kazzak, you're not seriously trying to say that storywise raids actively had an impact? Of course not. Ignoring raid activity, when BC was released the story became that kazzak was stranded and looking for a way to reopen the dark portal, and when he succeeded he went back through it.\
Regarding Kael, if you look at the quest from the verdant sphere itself, the quest specifically says you take it from a \"still twitching body\" of Kael. Upon turning it in, Adal also specifically says that Kael indeed was still alive when the raid party left. There was no decapitation, so while maimed the true killing blow was never delivered and thus he was able to leave after the raid left. They didnt exactly drag his body out for a trophy.\
\
Illidan however was specifically killed by Maiev, she wouldnt have left or expressed the comments of feeling nothing at having finally killed him. Having such hatred theres no way she wouldnt have given a mortal blow.\
Besides, Illidan turned insane, convincing himself that he actually beat Arthas instead of losing, so why would he return regardless.",

Illidan may be dead (at least until we get tired of killing him), but his legacy lives on. His actions during his life will forever leave an imprint in our memories, as despite his eventual fall into darkness, Illidan Stormrage DID save the world. Multiple times.",
    "1095999555301987252007/06/06 14:48:31KalJWheter he is actually dead or not in lore is still to be seen. While apparently Maiev killed him, in blizzard games there are several notable cases of npcs/bosses/characters that were killed only to come back alive and kicking in later games. Most notable examples are Medivh - killed in WC2 only to come back in WC3 - Kazzak, killed and raided to death only to become the one responsible for the dark portal opening and be promoted to TBC outdoor raidboss, and lastly Kael'thas sunstrider, which according to various comments turn out to be beaten but alive,  yelling in shattrath when you turn in the http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32405 to ada'l.\
I find it quite interesting that unlike several of the raid bosses that are confirmed to be 100% dead ( ossirian, nefarian, onyxia, maghteridon ) you don't get the \"head of Illidan\" as a quest starting item to turn in somewhere.\
Don't know what blizzard plans for him, but I wouldn't be surprised to have him leave BT to a lieutenant  demon hunter  and then run to Northrend ( or whatever will be the area for next xpac ) to settle scores with Arthas and become a level 80 raidboss,  just as it happened to Kazzak at the start of tbc.",

Mainly, I just got to thinking about it, and if they're making Death Knights a hero class they're certainly not leaving out Demon Hunter's. So why not have your demon hunter learn from the best one there is? If he really did die, I'm sure its not permanent and they'll bring him back if/when they come out with a Demon Hunter class just to do the same thing they're doing with Arthas. I could totally be wrong too, though. =P",

But if you choose to \"grind\" this quest I would suggest grinding the Crazed Murkblood Miner http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=23324 as they have a decent drop rate at about 1 in 3 and if they do not drop you are still getting good trade goods like Netherweave Cloth and Netherwing Eggs.\

    "1101588375190883752007/05/23 11:31:01ToaboBased on my first night of farming, this was the quest seemed the biggest time sink of the Neutral ->Friendly, but your results may vary.  (And if you're determined to be first on your block to be Exalted, you'll have to grit your teeth and power through it regardless.) \
\
These crystals drop from essentially any mob on Netherwing Ridge.  Above ground, you'll find nether rays lurking around the edges of the Ridge and flayers on the mountains further in.  The flayers are more densely packed for easy farming, but that also makes them popular with your fellow grinders.  The nether rays tend to be less over-farmed and the respawn rate is decent enough to keep a solo player from having too much downtime.  Only risk is that some of the nether ray packs are near paths of the patrolling elite drakonids.  These guys have ~100K health and hit hard, so best just to avoid them.  \
\
I found less competition in the underground mine, though that may change when more folks may find out about it.  On the other hand, it's much less convenient to get to since you can't fly, so maybe folks won't bother.\
\
You'll have to go fairly deep into the mine to find mobs.  You'll see slimes and worms mostly in the central tunnel as you enter.  Further in you'll get access to some side tunnels which feature flayers and ravagers.  Way in the back you'll find murkbloods (hostile, unlike the friendly ones at the mine entrance).  I was with a skinner, so we focused mostly on the flayers and ravagers and had decent results.  \
\
You can only turn in 40 Crystals per day, but you can collect as many as you can carry.  Thus, you can get a jump on the next day's turn-in by farming longer.",

All of the mobs in there drop crystals, so about every other day I had enough crystals to turn in the quest.  Between the races and finding eggs, there was no reason to farm for these when you could be doing something to get more money/rep.  If you look up netherwing eggs on youtube, there are several videos that can help you to find eggs that are far easier to get and net almost the same rep, or way more when you find 8-12 a day as I sometimes do.",

\
However, if you're dealing with three or more ring types, as of 2.1, there is a bug involving swapping your Violet Signet for a second time: if this is the second time you swap your Signet type, the game will think you currently have the ring that you originally picked when you hit Friendly reputation. This will cause you to get the wrong quest, which will ask for you to return that original, first ring, and not the one you currently have - so you can't swap your ring.\
\
For example (as in my case), if a character picks the Archmage ring, then later wants to switch to the Restorer ring, and later wants the Protector ring, they will be stuck with the Restorer ring, because Archmage Leryda will be asking for you to turn in the Archmage ring that does not exist.\
\
There is a simple fix to this, however - destroy your current ring, and talk to Archmage Leryda, and she will restore your first ring. This is verified by GMs; if you'd rather see for yourself, and you don't mind the four hour wait you can open a ticket and ask them yourselves.\

A list by Greengoo\
\
1. Kindness\
- Kill 8 Rocknail Flayers, Use Carcasses to Feed 8 Dragons (don't move!). Also make sure to travel a bit when laying the meat, as the same drakes won't eat twice in a row.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10804\
\
2. Seek Out Neltharaku\
- Fly on your mount and find Neltharaku, he patrols slowly around Dragonmaw about a few hundred feet up. You'll have to be about 5 yards UNDER him to talk to him.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10811\
\
3. Neltharaku's Tale\
- Listen to story.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10814\
\
4. Infiltrating Dragonmaw Fortress\
- Kill 15 of any type of orcs in the fortress.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10836\
\
5.To Netherwing Ledge!\
- Find 12 Crystals from the floating island SE of the mainland.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10837\
\
6. The Force of Neltharaku\
- Free 5 Dragons by using the item on them, then killing the orcs they agro.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10854\
\
7. Karynaku\
- Find Karynaku, she's the second story of the fortress.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10858\
\
8. Zuluhed the Whacked\
- Kill Zuluhed and recover the key. I recommend pulling him inside so as to avoid the archers, and kill him BEFORE he summons his add. Use the key he drops to free Karynaku.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10872\
\
9. Ally of the Netherwing\
- Return to Mordenai, you will immediately gain 42,000 rep and become neutral.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10870\
\
10. ????\
- Blizzard has announced that next patch they will be introducing a continuence of this quest line, including the ability to get exalted and purchase or receive through extensive questing an EPIC netherdrake mount. You will need epic training to use it however, so save your gold!",

After restarting the game, the peons weren't updating the quest until kill 13.  However, I noticed that if you manually track the quest, it does update.  So, if you get this quest, manually track the quest so you know how many kills you have left.",

Do the Ogri'la quests first so the ogres are neutral to you and you can generally pull the raptors separately by rooting the patrolling ones and attacking them after the accompanying ogre has moved off.  On the rare occasion they get linked in to another mob, just focus target the raptor and keep it slept whilst you take the ogre down first.  \
\
Fingrom was the only tricky part.  First off, make sure you've dealt with the patrol who wanders up and down to visit him.  Thereafter, good news - even though he's indoors you can still root him!  So stand in the doorway, open with a starfire, swiftly root him and move out of line of sight.  Straif back to cast moonfire, then straif out of line of sight again.  Straif back to cast insect swarm, then get back out of line of sight.  Rinse and repeat, leaving out the initial starfire.  If for any reason you're not fast enough and one of his fireballs hits you, one lifebloom is enough to get you back to full health.\

I used a boar because it holds aggro far better than any other pet (if it has Charge).  To kill the named, put the pet outside, downstairs, run up and misdirect to the pet, then shoot him.   Jump down immediately.  It's a bit tricky to place the pet so the \"boss\" doesn't have LoS because he is ranged, but worked for me.\

10. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10708 [70] Akama's Promise\
\
After you finish this chain, you get to pick from some rewards and the chain seems like it ends. It continues however, inside Serpentshrine Cavern (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3607) from an NPC called Seer Olum (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22820) who you can speak with after killing Fathom-Lord Karathress. He starts the next part of the Black Temple Chain by offering the quest:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10944 [70] The Secret Compromised\
For this quest you just return to Akama.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10946 [70] Ruse of the Ashtongue\
In this quest, you must use the costume Akama provides, and kill A'lar in Tempest Keep: The Eye while wearing the Ashtongue Cowl. Attunement for The Eye is a whole different chain.\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10947 [70] An Artifact From the Past\
In this, you need to gain access to The Battle of Mount Hyjal in Caverns of Time, and slay the first boss, Rage Winterchill. Attunement for this involves killing Lady Vashj and Kael'Thas Sunstrider.\
4. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10948 [70] The Hostage Soul\
For this you must speak with A'dal in Shattrath city.\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10949 [70] Entry into the Black Temple\
For this, just speak with the naaru Xi'ri in front of Black Temple.\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10985 [70] A Distraction for Akama\
Unknown what this quest asks of you, most likely you need to defend Xi'ri and make your way into Black Temple. At the end, you become attuned to enter and are granted The Medallion of Karabor (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32649)\
\
At this point, you are attuned and can enter Black Temple, although the chain continues and you can soon upgrade your medallion. It continues with:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10958 [70] Seek Out the Ashtongue\
You just need to find Seer Kanai (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=23158) inside Black Temple.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10957 [70] Redemption of the Ashtongue\
This involves entering Black Temple, and killing the boss the Shade of Akama (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22841).\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10959 [70] The Fall of the Betrayer\
After killing the Shade of Akama and returning to Seer Kanai, he asks one last thing of you. Kill Illidan The Betrayer. After doing so, you are granted the Blessed Medallion of Karabor, an upgraded version of your original medallion, and allows teleportation to the Black Temple.",

Just stay as tight to the wall as you can. One npc to be extra careful of is the fel reaver that patrols the short hallway leading into Blackheart's room. The reaver has a short patrol, stopping just past the end of each side of the hallway. It's safe to run past him (between the wall and the brazier at the corner) into the hall when he is at the end of his patrol, and then run into and around the corner into Blackheart's room. I got stuck in the brazier at the far end the first time and didn't make it into the room. The reaver stopped and stared at me a long time, but did not aggro. \
\
There are two tents near the dias where Blackheart walks around. \
\
The left-hand tent (as you approach Blackheart) has two soul devices, one near the front as you approach the tent, the other at the back of the tent. I did not try the one near the front as it required getting too close to the mobs on that side. The one at the back \"should\" be collectible, but for some reason I could not see the device from behind the tent, and could not find an angle where the device was both visible and in range. Some posters seemed to have found a way to do this, but I couldn't get the angle. \
\
The tent on the other side only has one soul device. Had the same problem with camera angle on this one, too, until I figured out that there is a tiny crease at the back of the tent that allowed me to see inside. I was able to collect this device, being very careful to stay at max distance possible before unstealthing. It's tricky, and I died a couple of times when I didn't have just the right position. \
\
So it's definitely doable, if you have a lot of patience and are willing to reset and re-enter multiple times.",

2- you can get into shadow lab without the key, by dying outside the gate and ressing inside. (fly up, and drop worked for me)\
\
3- if you harvest 1 soul device and reset each time, you'll not be able to go into another instance for 1 hour afterwards (You have entered too many instances recently!)\
\
\
How to collect the devices: the only one i found i could get was in Blackheart the Inciter's room, as you enter, its in a blue tent on the far right. There's 2 guys just outside the tent, and 2 devices, one of which is in the far right corner (looking at it as you enter the room)\

Go behind the corner of the tent, spin the camera around with left mouse button so you can see inside it, and loot. If you're about 2-3 yards away, you can loot without aggroing the guys. Run out, reset, repeat x5. takes about 4-5 mins per attempt.\
\
A note on the distance: if you're more than ~2-3 yards away when you right click on something, you character runs over to it, and stops next to it, and starts to open it. The problem with this is you stop VERY close to the item, say 1-2 yards from it. This will get aggro and you'll die.\
If you're about 2-3 yards away, you can still loot, but your character doesn't move forwards. \
This distance difference is crucial, turn 'always run' off, will help you move to the right place (default key is numpad slash: / )\
\
\
total time for soloing the whole chain was about an hour.",

\
I was unable to do it as a druid, I managed the first part of the quest by going around the boss as close to the wall as possible (he sees through stealth) and then received this quest.\
\
I found the tent as explained above, and knowing that I was too close to the mobs (even though I was as far as I could go and still operate the Soul Device) - I still unstealthed. I attempted from the back of the tent, and the left side while facing, and from the corner away from the mobs - and all three of the mobs there came after me every time.",

\
first enter the instance and make sure to stay out of the mobs agro ranges. use distract to keep them looking away from you. keep doing this till you reach the large room where the stands are. \
\
now go over to each side, there should be two mobs there. sap the closest one and begin to open the devices. when the other one agros use blind to get him away from you. finesh opening and use vanish when blind wears off. \
\
wait for your cooldowns to come back and repeat. there are only 4 stands in the room so you mite have to reset the instance once and go back in. \
\
yes it takes awhile but if you cant seem to get a shadow labs group going and need better armbands then its worth it",

If you very carefully go behind the tent, and edge closer to the soul devices, you are able to loot them and get away without pulling the mobs, then out -> reset -> repeat.\
\
However, this is coming from a mage, im not sure how easy it is to stealth to that room in the first place.\

\
The FGL will alone do about 1/3 damage to the Overseer before being killed.  I enslaved one FGL and sent him at the Overseer.  I then got in range of the other FGL.  When mine died I enslaved the other and sent him in.  Quickly killed the cannon myself and then added my DPS to the FGL's damage.  It worked pretty well.  For the second Overseer, he was still at about 5-10% health when my second FGL died so I just DoT-kited him a short ways.\
\
The whole chain is east to solo as a lock and prolly for most other classes as well if you're creative.  \

On my 67 elemental shaman, I was able to wiggle between the mobs surrounding the named guys and LB him, and then beginning to kite. \
They are immune to snares and roots and they both run at 100% movement speed, so you have to be very good with jump-turn-cast-turn-land-run. (don't worry, neither mob has a ranged attack)\
\
Other than that, my only problem was mana, With my shaman Water shield made it fairly easy, just recasting Flame shock as the dot drops off. This can be done with moonfire and warlock dots. I made it all the way to Garadar, and the guards made short work of them, causing alot of whispers by bystanders asking what I was doing. \
\
The only problem was the respawn rate, by the time I rode back to the spot, they were already respawned, so I had to kite Demos around the green thing infront of him and use a stoneclaw totem to make just enough time to finish the use of the cannon. XIrkos was a different story, I had to use my pocket tank (Earth Elemental Totem) which made it easy. However I have no clue how one would turn it in without the elemental. \
\
All and all, it was ALOT of fun and easily one of the best experiences Ive had in WoW.\

\
After you finish this chain, you get to pick from some rewards and the chain seems like it ends. It continues however, inside Serpentshrine Cavern (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3607) from an NPC called Seer Olum (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22820) who you can speak with after killing Fathom-Lord Karathress. He starts the next part of the Black Temple Chain by offering the quest:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10944 [70] The Secret Compromised\
For this quest you just return to Akama.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10946 [70] Ruse of the Ashtongue\
In this quest, you must use the costume Akama provides, and kill A'lar in Tempest Keep: The Eye while wearing the Ashtongue Cowl. Attunement for The Eye is a whole different chain.\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10947 [70] An Artifact From the Past\
In this, you need to gain access to The Battle of Mount Hyjal in Caverns of Time, and slay the first boss, Rage Winterchill. Attunement for this involves killing Lady Vashj and Kael'Thas Sunstrider.\
4. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10948 [70] The Hostage Soul\
For this you must speak with A'dal in Shattrath city.\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10949 [70] Entry into the Black Temple\
For this, just speak with the naaru Xi'ri in front of Black Temple.\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10985 [70] A Distraction for Akama\
Unknown what this quest asks of you, most likely you need to defend Xi'ri and make your way into Black Temple. At the end, you become attuned to enter and are granted The Medallion of Karabor (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32649)\
\
At this point, you are attuned and can enter Black Temple, although the chain continues and you can soon upgrade your medallion. It continues with:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10958 [70] Seek Out the Ashtongue\
You just need to find Seer Kanai (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=23158) inside Black Temple.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10957 [70] Redemption of the Ashtongue\
This involves entering Black Temple, and killing the boss the Shade of Akama (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22841).\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10959 [70] The Fall of the Betrayer\
After killing the Shade of Akama and returning to Seer Kanai, he asks one last thing of you. Kill Illidan The Betrayer. After doing so, you are granted the Blessed Medallion of Karabor, an upgraded version of your original medallion, and allows teleportation to the Black Temple.",

\
Otherwise, this quest is pretty hard. Since you have to kill 3-5 mobs to get to a tablet, and you need 12, it takes some time.\

7. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10705][70] Seer Udalo (Dungeon)[/url]\
\
Here, you have to venture into the [b]Arcatraz[/b] (which requires a Rogue with 350 lockpicking or somebody to open the door who's completed the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10262]Arcatraz Key chain[/url], which requires trips to the Mechanar and the Botanica respectively) to the room just before the final boss.  Sadly it's (nearly) impossible to stealth to.  Finding Udalo leads to:\
\
Talk to Akama:\
8. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10706][70] A Mysterious Portent[/url]\
Kill waves of nonelites, 3 elites and a boss (5-man) on a terrace outside the Black Temple:\

Finally, deliver the medallion to A'dal in Shattrath City:\
10. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10708][70] Akama's Promise[/url]\

\
1. Have your pet on auto-growl and manually set it to attack every infernal as they're summoned. AoE effects like Thunderstomp and Screech are not good enough - you need your pet to growl to get sufficient aggro.\
2. Lay down frost traps (NOT freezing traps) every chance you get. Since Levixus himself is immune to slowing/freezing effects, he'll start walking way ahead of his infernals, thus buying you time.\
3. Do a Mend Pet every time you do a Call Pet. It'll need that health.\
4. Keep aspect of the pack/cheetah on at all times. \
5. Make sure you know where the camp is and what the shortest route to it is. I accidentally dragged Levixus into the middle of the wrong camp, dragging him way farther than I actually had to.\
6. Don't worry about doing damage. Save your mana for Mend Pet and trapping.\
7. Once you get to the camp and the guards start beating up Levixus, lay down the smack. I unleashed hell and still didn't get aggro over the guards. And even if I had, I could just have feigned death.\
\
Congratulations if you can accomplish this. Especially if you weren't 70 at the time. It's a remarkably interesting encounter in that it tests the skill of the player, rather than the character. I dare say that even an epicced out level 70 character couldn't solo Levixus in a flat face-to-face encounter. You have to use your wits to win. So if you manage, be proud. You've earned it.",

The key is to put out a few Frost Shocks for the increased threat, drop Grounding Totem when he's casting Cripple on you, then spam any rank 1 Shock in order to keep the tag.  Then it's just a matter of weaving between mobs to get to the camp.\
\
If you get an Infernals on you, drop an Earthbind or Stoneclaw Totem so you can get some distance on them.  Once you get to the Sha'tar Vindicators, they'll peel the Infernals off of you then beat on Levixus himself.\
\
P.S. Don't forget to use Water Shield.  You'll probably have enough time before reaching the camp for it to drop at least twice, so that's a free 1k mana at worst.",

Either banish (sometimes risky, they tend to resist a lot) or Curse of Exhaustion the infernals, and they eventually despawn. Also, keep the felhunter out, as you can devour cripple off yourself.\

You'll need to make a wide circle when going up and down the stairs, and you will probably get hit with cripple (which is no problem if you are quick with your felhunter). If you cut the corner too sharp, he will evade and reset.",

\
Spawns alone at 40,71 along the south ring of Auchindoun. Though he runs slow, he summons 2 infernals that run at normal speed. This makes kiting him a bit more of a challenge but not beyond doing. The first time I did him solo, I pulled him all the way over to the clefthoof area in the eastern part of the bone wastes. Running around in a circle with cheetah on till he dropped. \
\
The second time I was killing him, I decided to give a less exciting, somewhat cheesy, approach. I noticed that his adds, the infernals, had a 33 damage pulsing aura so I drug the pull through the outpost in the SW corner of the bone wastes. As I expected, the guards netted and mobbed them quickly.\
\
So the easiest way to do the quest would be to have a hunter friend kite them to the outpost and collect the book after. Cheese, but effective.\
\
One more important note: If you do melee him with a group, he casts cripple a lot so expect it to be a slow going fight. Also, his adds die after about 2 minutes from spawn time, but he recasts them while he's alive.",

I entangled his infernals as he summoned them. Travel form kited him through the fighting Sha'tar guys so they helped me out on the infernals, through to the SW Sha'tar camp and ran around in circles while they finished him off. Whenever he stopped to fight the Sha'tar guys I wrath spammed him to make sure I did a fair percentage of damage.\

I didn't use/abuse the guards, I kited him east along the platform where he spawns, then down the first set of steps, then along the bottom to the steps by where he spawns.  Then repeated the circle until he died.\
\
I used 2 super mana potions and 2 Innervates and oscillated between rank 1 moonfire for mana conservation and rank 12 moonfire for damage.  \
\
Maintain max range, hitting him with moonfire whenever the dot is up.  Be careful when you're going up and down stairs and around pillars as he can go out of line of sight and then evade home if your dot runs out.   When he summons an infernal dot him then strafe away until the infernal is slightly in front of him.  Hopefully he'll start casting cripple and you can root the infernal safely.  If not root before the infernal gets too close as they interrupt a lot.  Barkskin if necessary.  If you screw up and he starts beating on you, you can normally survive long enough to sprint away in cat form and then heal with HOTs.  Just be careful the dot doesn't expire when you're running for distance.\

Bounce into travel form to remove cripple.",

1. Accept the quest from Jesper (He's located in: Stormwind: 47,35) (People with no cords:he's located in the orphan house just abit north from the east enterance of the Cathedral Square,just check the map for a little house shaped orange square.)\
2. Head to Stormwind's main Inn (53,65) (People with no cords:it's just to the right from the water fountain located in the Trade District)\
3.Speak to the inn keeper and accept the quest,do a /flex emotion at her and grab the Stormwind Nougat.\
4. Take the Deeprun Tram to Ironforge\
5. In Ironforge head to Talvash Del Kissel. (34,6) (People with no cords: He's just east of the Mage trainer hall in The Mystic Ward)\
6. Accept the quest and do a /train emotion at him,grab the Gnomeregan Gumdrop.\
7. Now go to Ironforges main Inn located at. (21,53) (People with no cords: It's abit north from the auction house,just check the signs above the buildings north of the AH.)\
8. Accept the quest and do a /chicken emotion at the inn keeper,grab the Ironforge mint.\
9. At this point,if you're a druid then use Teleport: Moonglade and fly to Darnassus. If not you're going to have to hearthstone to shattarth (That is if you have it,if you don't fly to menethil harbor and take the boat to auberdine,then to darnassus.)\
10. At darnassus head to the inn at: (68,15) (People with no cords: Just open your map and head to the \"S\"  in the Craftmens Terrace.)\
11. Accept the quest and do a /dance emotion at the inn keeper. grab the marzipan and you're done :).\
Now head back to Stormwind and make an orphan happy.\
I hope this is any help to anybody.",

    "8311177308201773082007/10/31 13:32:17wowisashthe quest start by going INSIDE the orphanage in Cathedral district in SW, and taking the quest from Jesper (I didn't see the sign, but sure want to now!) \
\
(if you are lower level, you may want to set your HS to SW, just to make it easier) \
\
First, go to the Inn by the bank in Trade district. The innkeeper will have a ! above her; talk to her, and get the Stormwind Nougat by typing /flex, and then talking to her again after the ? shows up. \
\
*She will have ANOTHER !, but just ignore it, and move on! \
\
Next, on to IF. If you are really low level, it is easiest to just take the tram. otherwise, tram or griffin - your choice. \
\
In IF there are 2 - the Gnome is in the Mystic Ward, just to the right of the gnome area, if you exit the tram and go left. You will see him in the corner, on a building porch. For the Gumdrop, talk to him, /train, and collect. \
\
For the Mint, talk to the Innkeeper close to the bank/AH. He wants you to do a /cluck or /chicken. Again, collect the candy. \
\
The last one, well - was easy for me, or any druid(ess) able to get to Moonglade - just teleport to MG, and take the hipp flight to Teladrassil. Run up into Darn, ask any guard where the inn is. \
\
Go over to the inn, talk to her, do a /dance (nice Jay-Z ref there), and collect your Marzipan. If your HS is set to SW, just hearth on back. \
\
The only problem I see is if you are really low level, and need to get to Darnassus. My only suggestion is to put a VERY NICE REQUEST into General, seeing if a friendly mage will open a portal. Explain your level, and what quest it is for. If you are in IF, ask for a Darn portal, and then plan on HSing back. \
\
As for the treats, yep - you collect 30 of the things; the effects are cool, but they will all disappear in 14 days after collection (unlike the other candies you buy). \
\
ps - do NOT forget about the apples!!! They are awesome for any level - not only do the yrestore MOST of your health and mana, but also give a temp 25% boost to both spirit & stamina!!!",

After you finish this chain, you get to pick from some rewards and the chain seems like it ends. It continues however, inside Serpentshrine Cavern (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3607) from an NPC called Seer Olum (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22820) who you can speak with after killing Fathom-Lord Karathress. He starts the next part of the Black Temple Chain by offering the quest:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10944 [70] The Secret Compromised\
For this quest you just return to Akama.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10946 [70] Ruse of the Ashtongue\
In this quest, you must use the costume Akama provides, and kill A'lar in Tempest Keep: The Eye while wearing the Ashtongue Cowl. Attunement for The Eye is a whole different chain.\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10947 [70] An Artifact From the Past\
In this, you need to gain access to The Battle of Mount Hyjal in Caverns of Time, and slay the first boss, Rage Winterchill. Attunement for this involves killing Lady Vashj and Kael'Thas Sunstrider.\
4. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10948 [70] The Hostage Soul\
For this you must speak with A'dal in Shattrath city.\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10949 [70] Entry into the Black Temple\
For this, just speak with the naaru Xi'ri in front of Black Temple.\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10985 [70] A Distraction for Akama\
Unknown what this quest asks of you, most likely you need to defend Xi'ri and make your way into Black Temple. At the end, you become attuned to enter and are granted The Medallion of Karabor (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32649)\
\
At this point, you are attuned and can enter Black Temple, although the chain continues and you can soon upgrade your medallion. It continues with:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10958 [70] Seek Out the Ashtongue\
You just need to find Seer Kanai (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=23158) inside Black Temple.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10957 [70] Redemption of the Ashtongue\
This involves entering Black Temple, and killing the boss the Shade of Akama (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22841).\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10959 [70] The Fall of the Betrayer\
After killing the Shade of Akama and returning to Seer Kanai, he asks one last thing of you. Kill Illidan The Betrayer. After doing so, you are granted the Blessed Medallion of Karabor, an upgraded version of your original medallion, and allows teleportation to the Black Temple.",

The rocknail flayers do a physical debuff called \"flayer flesh\", which increases the physical damage you take by 87ish damage you take for the next 15 seconds. Sadly, there is about one rocknail flayer per spawn. However, there is at least 10 different Rocknail spawns so lack of mobs shouldn't be an issue.\
\
The rocknail rippers do a physical debuff called rend flesh, which is basicly a DoT. The damage DoT does is also effected by \"flayer flesh\". The rocknail flayers are bigger than the rocknail rippers. \
\
Both the rocknail flayers and the rocknail rippers are melee. They do not cast anything.\
\
Watch out for Ruul, an elite lvl 68-72 mob that wanders around the area. From a distance Ruul looks like a very large dragonkin (about two times larger than the drakes), but that is actually Ruul's mount.\
\
[b]Drops[/b]\
The Rockanil Flayers drop a Rocknail Flayer Carcass at least 99% per kill. The rocknail rippers drop one Rocknail Flayer Giblets at least 99% per kill. If you have five rocknail flayer giblets, you can find it in your bag and right click on it to turn it into a Rocknail Flayer Carcass. For this reason, you want to kill the Rocknail Flayers as much as possible. \
\
[b]Feeding the drakes[/b]\
There are two ways of doing this. \
\
The first way is:\
Once you have one Rocknail flayer carcass, try to find a drake. They tend to fly 100-200 yards above the ground. Once you can see one, target it and then use the rocknail flayer carcass. If you do not target a drake first, you will get a red system error saying no target. It takes about four seconds for you to drop the rocknail flayer carcass. When you do you have to stick around for up to 30 seconds before the drake you targeted lands on the ground and starts to eat the rocknail flayer carcass. Once the drake has eaten the carcass, it will have a debuff called fed. You do not get credit for feeding it until the drake lands, eats the carcass, and says something in draconic. Do not try to feed a drake with a feed debuff. This will only result in you waisting your carcasses. For this reason this quest can be a bit of a pain on PvP servers.\
\
The second way is this:\
First gather up eight rocknail flayer carcass. Then head to 67, 52. There are at least 10 hungry drakes there at any given time. Although ruul goes through the area, it is very easy to avoid him if you are watching out for him.  It's virtually impossible to aggro any of the rocknails unless you aren't watching what your doing.\
Target a drake and then use a rocknail flayer carcass there. It will take about three seconds for you to drop it. When you do you have to stick around for up to 30 seconds before the drake you targeted lands on the ground and starts to eat the rocknail flayer carcass. Once the drake has eaten the carcass, it will have a debuff called fed. You do not get credit for feeding it until the drake lands, eats the carcass, and says something in draconic. Do not try to feed a drake with a feed debuff. The problem with this way is the rocknail carcass has a 30 seconds cooldown, so you can only use a rocknail caracass once every 30 seconds.",

A list by Greengoo\
\
1. Kindness\
- Kill 8 Rocknail Flayers, Use Carcasses to Feed 8 Dragons (don't move!). Also make sure to travel a bit when laying the meat, as the same drakes won't eat twice in a row.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10804\
\
2. Seek Out Neltharaku\
- Fly on your mount and find Neltharaku, he patrols slowly around Dragonmaw about a few hundred feet up. You'll have to be about 5 yards UNDER him to talk to him.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10811\
\
3. Neltharaku's Tale\
- Listen to story.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10814\
\
4. Infiltrating Dragonmaw Fortress\
- Kill 15 of any type of orcs in the fortress.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10836\
\
5.To Netherwing Ledge!\
- Find 12 Crystals from the floating island SE of the mainland.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10837\
\
6. The Force of Neltharaku\
- Free 5 Dragons by using the item on them, then killing the orcs they agro.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10854\
\
7. Karynaku\
- Find Karynaku, she's the second story of the fortress.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10858\
\
8. Zuluhed the Whacked\
- Kill Zuluhed and recover the key. I recommend pulling him inside so as to avoid the archers, and kill him BEFORE he summons his add. Use the key he drops to free Karynaku.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10872\
\
9. Ally of the Netherwing\
- Return to Mordenai, you will immediately gain 42,000 rep and become neutral.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10870\
\
10. ????\
- Blizzard has announced that next patch they will be introducing a continuence of this quest line, including the ability to get exalted and purchase or receive through extensive questing an EPIC netherdrake mount. You will need epic training to use it however, so save your gold!",

\
The Black Temple attunement starts at The Altar of the Sha'tar for Aldors, and the Sanctum of the Sun for Scryers. Both are in Shadowmoon Valley.\
\
Aldors start attunement from Anchorite Ceyla (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21402) at the Altar of Sha'tar in Shadowmoon Valley:\

\
After that, the chain comes together for Aldor and Scryer.\
\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10622 [70] Proof of Allegiance\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10628 [70] Akama\
7. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10705 [70] Seer Udalo\
\
Seer Udalo is found in the Arcatraz (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3846) just before the last boss.\
\
8. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10706 [70] A Mysterious Portent\
9. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10707 [70] The Ata'mal Terrace\
10. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10708 [70] Akama's Promise\
\
After you finish this chain, you get to pick from some rewards and the chain seems like it ends. It continues however, inside Serpentshrine Cavern (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3607) from an NPC called Seer Olum (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22820) who you can speak with after killing Fathom-Lord Karathress. He starts the next part of the Black Temple Chain by offering the quest:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10944 [70] The Secret Compromised\
For this quest you just return to Akama.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10946 [70] Ruse of the Ashtongue\
In this quest, you must use the costume Akama provides, and kill A'lar in Tempest Keep: The Eye while wearing the Ashtongue Cowl. Attunement for The Eye is a whole different chain.\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10947 [70] An Artifact From the Past\
In this, you need to gain access to The Battle of Mount Hyjal in Caverns of Time, and slay the first boss, Rage Winterchill. Attunement for this involves killing Lady Vashj and Kael'Thas Sunstrider.\
4. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10948 [70] The Hostage Soul\
For this you must speak with A'dal in Shattrath city.\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10949 [70] Entry into the Black Temple\
For this, just speak with the naaru Xi'ri in front of Black Temple.\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10985 [70] A Distraction for Akama\
Unknown what this quest asks of you, most likely you need to defend Xi'ri and make your way into Black Temple. At the end, you become attuned to enter and are granted The Medallion of Karabor (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32649)\
\
At this point, you are attuned and can enter Black Temple, although the chain continues and you can soon upgrade your medallion. It continues with:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10958 [70] Seek Out the Ashtongue\
You just need to find Seer Kanai (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=23158) inside Black Temple.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10957 [70] Redemption of the Ashtongue\
This involves entering Black Temple, and killing the boss the Shade of Akama (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22841).\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10959 [70] The Fall of the Betrayer\
After killing the Shade of Akama and returning to Seer Kanai, he asks one last thing of you. Kill Illidan The Betrayer. After doing so, you are granted the Blessed Medallion of Karabor, an upgraded version of your original medallion, and allows teleportation to the Black Temple.",

\
After reading all the comments about how horrible this quest was, I had skipped it initially... however, desperate for a little extra rep, I went and did it... and it's VERY QUICK and EASY for us.\
\
Head to the pool at Eclipse Point (46,61), round up about half of the Dimetradons there, and AoE them down.  Rest up, do the other half.  The first half will start respawning while you rest up again.  Only took a few pulls to get all the glands I needed!",

    "1102088393181875432007/05/23 11:50:59ToaboThis quest is the most conducive to grouping of the Neutral->Friendly series.  All you need is a total of 12 Fel Glands for your entire group.  (For example, if you have 5 and your buddy has 7, you're good to go.)  \
\
Once you've got that, fly back and have one (and only one) person use Yarzill's Mutton near a peon camp.  The peons will wander over, eat the meat, and die.  Everyone in the group who is nearby will get credit.  \
\
Do not have more than one person use the Mutton per camp.  The peons will only eat the first one, so you won't get credit for the second one and you'll have to farm another Fel Gland.",
    "1102097541230975412007/06/03 17:20:44EvilDeathCrabSome useful tips to avoid bugging:\
- Don't drop food by the ones that are standing in a big clump and not mining (you don't see the picks moving). \
- Make sure that there's at least two or three peons in each camp, so don't put one by a solitary peon because that's probably someone who did the booterang quest.\
- Drop the meat an equal distance away from all peons (see note below)\
\
Note: I'm pretty sure the \"bug\" lies in the position of the little haunch of meat relative to the peons.  The \"event\" that occurs to give you credit for the camp is only started when ALL the peons in that camp (two or three of them) have run up to the mutton.  If you place the mutton to close to one of the peons in the group, all the other peons will run towards the mutton except for the one that's already \"close enough.\"  Unfortunately, it seems that the \"I'm close enough\" check doesn't trigger the \"I'm at the meat\" check, and that peon never moves.  The other two peons will typically clump on top of that peon, creating the \"bugged groups\" that you often see.\
\
Solution:  Make sure there's a decent gap between any given peon and the mutton you drop.  You can stand a few yards away and still get them all to run.  Just don't be hasty and drop mutton on top of a peon, because that will probably result in the bug.\
\
I've done a little testing, but if anyone feels like wasting some glands to test this, feel free :D",
    "1102091160171875432007/05/26 16:32:39kdangerAlso make sure that you only choose camps where the peons are actually mining the crystals. If they are just standing there they will not eat the mutton and you will have to farm up another fel gland to replace the one you just lost.",
    "110209066760906672007/05/26 00:20:51mulphaYou find Felfire Diemetradons wish drops Fel Glands at 47,60. Kinda good place.",
    "110209868270986822007/06/05 12:53:16CagliostroFor the people that want more than 12 of those Fel glands, just grind 12, poison the peons and don't hand the quest in yet, instead go grind 12 some more.\
That way you're ready for the day after if you don't have much time to grind all Fel Glands again.\
Or a good way is to group up as the other comments above me say.",
    "110209559971875432007/06/01 20:03:45laughingdogMore importantly, make sure they are ALL working.  I've had bugged ones where one was standing there and the others were working.  Once I'd drop the food, the others would just walk next to that one and stand there.\
\
Grouping with this seems to be ideal.  I have never been able to get a 13th gland to drop for me (which may be bad luck), and I always seem to have at least one group bug.  If you have a group, it's much easier to have spares.",
    "11020183608101836082007/11/13 17:02:35CerberusDon't bother with this quest unless you're doing it together with somebody else. The droprate is 1 in 5 at best meaning you'll have to kill 60 mobs on average to complete. Dismounting and mounting 12 times while dodging 72 elites and making sure your peons are working just adds to the annoyance. You're guaranteed to find at least one egg worth the same rep just by flying back and forth between the fortress, cave and outer islands in the time it takes to complete this Q. \
\
Check comments on the eggs for the good spots\
http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32506#comments\
\
edit: The droprate on glands is probably a lot higher due to people killling mobs without having this quest, but it's still not worthwhile doing this quest over farming eggs imo.",

I killed off 11 peons with the meat, then went back to kill more Diemetrodons for more Fel Glands and was able to get up to 12 again but no more.  I even tried sticking the Glands in the bank to see if that would work, but to no avail.  At least tomorrow I'll only need one more Gland to finish the quest!",

\
The Nethereskates are the closest things that drop Fel Glands and they also drop motes of mana, so it may be worth farming the glands from them.",

After spending way too much time farming trash mobs on the mainland of SMV (which do not drop crystals or eggs) you get to look forward to getting a 11/12 completion when one camp bugs out on you. I avoid the camps that look buged, and still have at least one bug on me more often then not. The least they could do to make up for poor programming is allow us to pick up 13 or 14 just to be safe. But nope.\

\
[b]Summoning[/b]\
Inside the Graveyard, an altar will appear, with an pumpkin upon it. Behind it, is a pile of dirt. By speaking to the pumpkin, you can get a candle, which delivered to the dirtpile behind, will summon the boss. He'll soar out, fly about a bit, and then land, charging the summoner. This will consume a Daily Quest, and can only be done once every two hours, I believe.  Summoning him requires level 70.\
\
 [b]Stage one[/b]\
Tank time. Nothing exciting happens. The tank tanks, DPS does DPS, and the healer heals.\
As soon as he hits 1%, his head will pop off, and land at a random location. If this head doesn't get damaged down to about 65% before his body hits 100% again, you have to fight through phase one again.\
\
[b]Stage two[/b]\
Ok, head reaches 65%, flies back to his body, and you're fighting again. This time, he has a new ability. Conflagrate. It'll do 10% damage for 5 ticks on a random target. It also does 10% damage to anyone close to that target, so try to move away quickly.\
Once he hits 1%, his head pops off again, so try to hit it down to 30%.\
\
[b]Stage three[/b]\
When the head hits 30%, he becomes whole again, and you're fighting agin. This time, he gets the ability to summon four helpful pumpkin guys. If you're quick, they should only have time to spawn before the Headless Horseman is dead. If not, try to kill the horseman anyway.\
The pumpkins don't do very much damage, but can disrupt  the healer. The Headless Horseman will summon four adds every now-and-then, while conflagrating and hitting the tank as usual. At 1% his head flies off, and you've got a floating skull. Kill it quickly, and party. Now go and loot the various drops he has.\
\
[b]The Looting[/b]\
The Headless Horseman usually drops anything between two to four items, maybe even five.\
Two items that are guaranteed to appear, are both a Broom and any of the three kinds of rings.\

    "1103517780911950062007/11/01 17:50:29jolthammerAlso, another item that is great for Paladin pulling is the \"Six Demon Bag\".  It's a Blue Trinket and works great.  It's a World Drop I believe, so you'll want to loo for it at the Auction House.  At this point in your career, I think you can afford it.\
\
If you are confused about where to stand for this (as I was at first), Go the floating rock at 71,75 and stand near the NW corner of this rock.  Look North.  Look up in the sky at about a 30-45 degree angle.  The transporters will swoop down to this rock along the right side of the rock and that's where you pick them off.  \
\
For this quest Palys, I'm using the Boomerang, the Six Demon Bag, and Holy Shock to pull these guys.  While one is on cooldown, I'm pulling with another.\
----\
\
Update 11.14.07 - As of last night (Patch 2.3), the route of the transporters has been changed a bit for this floating rock. The transporters have been rerouted about 10 yards to the North, making them swoop right down to the middle of this rock, instead of the to the south of the rock. It is much easier for us Palys to pull them without trinkets.",
    "110358843670884362007/05/23 12:39:06ToaboMy friend and I did our farming at the wooden ramp on the northern edge of the Ridge towards the east side.  (Not sure on coordinates, but I'm sure someone else has mentioned it above.)  Transporters take-off and land here frequently, so it's a good farming spot (if you can get to it first).  \
\
There are two elite drakonids guarding the platform who can and will crush you if aggroed.  Attacks on any Transporter on the platform will aggro the drakonids.  For this reason, I recommend recommend ignoring arrivals and focusing on departures.  The incoming Transporters are tricky to target and hit before they get too close to the guards.\
\
The departing Transporters are fairly easy once you learn their routine.  They'll spawn at the back of the platform, walk to the northern edge, pause slightly, and then take off.  As soon as the Transporter is airborne, you can safely pull them without aggroing the guards.  \
\
The Transporter moves fairly quickly, so you'll need to be ready to get aggro before he gets out range.  Don't worry; the timing is pretty easy to master.  My rogue friend never had a problem hitting him with a thrown knife.  As a mage, I found Fire Blast didn't give me sufficient range, but Scorch or Fireball worked just fine.  (Fireball is a little trickier because of the longer cast time, but solution is to start casting Fireball before the Transporter is airborne.)  \
\
One last issue for long-range nukers:  be careful not to overdo it while the Transporter is airborne.  It is possible to kill the Transporter in mid-air and, given your proximity to the edge, the corpse may not be lootable.  \
\
The best part about this location:  a new Transporter spawns every ~25 seconds, so you're assured a steady stream of mobs (plus a stack of corpses at your feet).  As a mage, I personally never had to move from my pulling spot.  Target, nuke, nuke, nuke, loot, wait for next.  Very simple.",
    "11035109104101091042007/06/22 05:32:03DarthshatnerThis quest kinda just... sucks.\
\
You're going to spend a lot of time waiting around for the transporters to fly by. The drop rate is a little less than 40%, so you're going to wait for even MORE transporters to fly by.\
\
The mobs don't have a whole lot of HP and are fairly easy to kill, with the exception of their aimed shot, which hits me (Rogue) for around 2400. There's no cast bar for this ability, but you can usually tell they're about to do it when they pull out their crossbow for more than a second or two (though ocassionally they'll bug out and you'll get nailed with aimed shot while they're standing around holding a sword). They are immune to blind and gouge, so fellow Rogues will have to rely on KS to interrupt the aimed shot. If your KS fails, brace for impact! =P Once or twice, I've also had the mob aimed shot me immediately after coming out of stun, so just make sure to heal up between fights.",

    "11035143641101436412007/08/25 01:46:30DweiaThe best spot to get those guys is the floating island right right across form the take off point. There are three different flight paths - directly from the take off, one from the left, one from the right. Standing there, you can kill them non stop (most of the time).\
\
Still, this quest is a pain. Playing a warrior, the reduced range is an issue when pulling them as well, especially if I'm not alone on said island - any ranged character can easily tag them all before I reach them.",
    "110359333530933352007/05/30 00:36:41KurimuSome tips:\
\
1) You can pull these guys either on the rocks floating directly north of the wooden launch ramp, or the ramp itself.  There are 2 rocks where they seem to patrol over.  There's also a few hills back on the continent you can pull them from as well.\
\
2) To avoid their 2.3k omgwtfaimshotpwned ability, adjust your camera so you can watch them fight.  When you see them stop their axe animation and pull back their bow, it's your cue to STUN.  That'll stop their aimed shot.  (They also do a similar animation for their poison shots, but it's not as long.)\
\
3) The drop rate's around 20-30%.  Ouch.",

Then you can nuke them all you want. Be ready to entangle again if your first disappears though. As long as you keep them in the air, you're perfectly safe from harm.\
\
And if you accidently kill the transporter while it's still in the air, just shift into flight form and you can loot him.",

Yes, it sucks, the two trees weakest for a paladin to kill random mobs are the only two that can 'easily' pull these...\

(Though, after the 10th one you start getting the pattern down)\

I'm still looking for other / better spots, but the eastern rock didn't work out well.. western rock in one spot (the highest point) is the only floating rock i've been able to reliably agro them on...\
\
the fortress doesnt seem to have them within 10 yards of the ground at any point their spawn point in the fortress is about 20 yards above the top of the tower... too bad, if they actually came NEAR The tower you could fight them on the 1 foot wide ledge >.<",

\
The dragons aren't that hard to shoot out of the sky from the island right near the wooden dock, and they fly over often enough to ensure a steady stream of kills. The drop rate was okay--had to kill probably around 30 to get my 10 relics.\
\
An odd bug we found--at one point I shot down a dragon and it came down but no orc appeared. Even though he didn't appear, though, he was still attacking. Seems like a variation on the bugged mobs that can't be hit but that can hit you even when you run far out of range.",

You see everything passing buy from there. Two sets of Transporters will always leave Dragonmaw in two flight patterns, you pick the flight pattern closest to you in flight parth. I added a Photo pic to reference.\
\
All i do is wait for the Transporters to pass by and either throw Avengers Shield or Mana tap the Transporters passing by and got aggro. Mana tapping them as a Blood Elf always work easily and easy as that. You can stay at location and take a break if you want to and nothing will attack you. Drop rate for me and doing it several days was maybe somewhere 40-50% for the relics. I've done it several days and its average about that. If you got worst luck than that then you got plain bad luck.\

\
As of Patch WoW patch 2.2 you can't pull the boss away from his elite bodyguards the usual way anymore using a weapon pull, this will make his bodyguards come for you.\
OBS! As it might have been mentioned in above comments however, you can still use the \"Bloodmaul Brutebane Kegs\" to lure the ogres out - this includes him! \
\
How to:\
\
Kill the front 2 guards, usually a brute and a shaman - these can be pulled one by one and is easy to kill. Next go exactly far enough in to stand halfway between the bonfire and the entrance, inside the room, plant a \"Brutemaul Brutebane Keg Brew\" on the floor and back up. The Boss will react immidiatly but if its too far away he won't notice. If u accedently place it to far away wait for the CD and try place one closer in. Once he reaches the brew you can freely pull and kill him without having to deal with his bodyguards!\
Remember! - It might be adviseable to bring more then 2 brews incase u accedently place one wrong, and its annoying having to run out and find anther in the middle of the quest!\

NOTE:  If the non elite is a shaman, hug the wall that they're closest to so that you'r out of their line of sight and are forced to come to you.\

Once the Non-Elites are down get a few steps away from the fire. TAKE THIS STEP SLOW SO YOU DONT AGGRO THE ELITES. And place 1 brew. Once he's aggro'd, pull back to the doorway just in case you accidently move to close and aggro the elites.\

I have been doing the daily quests (Skyguard, Ogrila, Netherwing) for several weeks now, and I believe this one is a waste of time compared to the others. Let me explain:\
\
Basically, people are doing these daily quests for two reasons: money and reputation. Now, this quest is given in Shadowmoon Valley, but is performed in Nagrand (on the western side no less), so completely on the other side of the Outland world map. Moreover, it is not as easy as the other available daily quests such as bombing runs (skettis/ogrila), escort, the mining/pollen quests, relic emanations, etc, because several lvl 72 elites are patrolling the area (even more annoying than the dragonmaw ascendant if you see what I mean....). So if you are doing 10 daily quests for money, spare this one IMO, it is not time efficient.\
\
The only reason why I would make that detour daily to complete this quest would be if I was really in a hurry to do the netherwing rep grind.",
    "110861015381101015382007/06/09 19:29:30Vastsomething that may help out, (especially for warriors out there..since this is what I use to do this daily) at roughly coords 8, 43, there is a arch - like structure where roughly 8 to 10 spellbinders are connected to it via their little \"energy-streams\". the arch way runs fairly north to south with the mobs on the east and west side. on the east side, there is a stairway which climbs up onto the platform of the arch (not far off the ground, just a bit). I killed the mobs on the east side, usually hitting one would aggro a second, but not always, until the east side was clear. once it was, i would climb the stairs and hit with ranged one of the mobs on the west side. these ones have to run all the way around to the east and get to the stairs before they would try casting on you. also, they would only aggro one at a time (so far that i have encountered). killing the mobs here gets you away from the patrolling elites, which means less ghost walks. (yes, trial and error meant i have done too many ghost walks here already). i hope this helps someone out there...it is one of the more frustrating daily quests for myself, mainly because of the elite pats.",

Suggestions:\
- Start this quest @ 13,35 (Nagrand)\
- Agent types are: archon, spellbinder, warlock and acolyte (all orcs).\
- Better to avoid Deathshadow overlord (ogre lvl 71 elite, 32k hp, hits cloths for 1300, cast fireball or shadowbolt for 2k, not immune to crowd control).\
- Better to avoid Reth'hedron the Subduer (demon lvl 73 elite).\

I never get more than one aggroing, these mobs have a surprisingly low aggro radius. No danger of pulling any of the nearby elites either. Perfect spot to get all 20 kills for any ranged class.\
\
The mobs won't aggro you while you're standing in the arch, so you're safe to eat/drink whenever you need to. The mobs on the west side run all the way around to the stairs before they even attack you, so if you have dots it's a great time to use them. These mobs also drop Mark of Sargeras and Fel Armament for you Aldor players out there.",

\
[quote]\
Greetings, <name>.  I will guide you through the cavern. Please try and keep up.\
\
We do not know if the Caverns of Time have always been accessible to mortals.  Truly, it is impossible to tell as the Timeless One is in perpetual motion, changing our timeways as he sees fit.  What you see now may very well not exist tomorrow.  You may wake up and have no memory of this place.\
\
It is strange, I know... Most mortals cannot actually comprehend what they see here, as often, what they see is not anchored within their own perception of reality.\
\
Follow me, please. [i]<The Custodian leads you to the entrance of the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=2367]Old Hillsbrad[/url] timeway.>[/i]\
\
There are only two truths to be found here: First, that time is chaotic, always in flux, and completely malleable and second, perception does not dictate reality.\
\
As custodians of time, we watch over and care for [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Nozdormu]Nozdormu's[/url] realm.  The master is away at the moment, which means that attempts are being made to dramatically alter time.  The master never meddles in the affairs of mortals but instead corrects the alterations made to time by others.  He is reactionary in this regard.\
\
For normal maintenance of time, the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?faction=989]Keepers of Time[/url] are sufficient caretakers.  We are able to deal with most ordinary disturbances.  I speak of little things, such as rogue mages changing something in the past to elevate their status or wealth in the present.\
\
These tunnels that you see are called timeways.  They are infinite in number.  The ones that currently exist in your reality are what the master has deemed as 'trouble spots.' These trouble spots may differ completely in theme but they always share a cause.  That is, their existence is a result of the same temporal disturbance.  Remember that should you venture inside one...\
\
This timeway is in great disarray!  We have agents inside right now attempting to restore order.  What information I have indicates that [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=17876]Thrall's[/url] freedom is in jeopardy.  A malevolent organization known as the [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Infinite_Dragonflight]Infinite Dragonflight[/url] is trying to prevent his escape.  I fear without outside assistance, all will be lost.\
\
Follow me, please. [i]<The Custodian leads you to the entrance of the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=2366]Black Morass[/url] timeway.>[/i]\
\
We have very little information on this timeway.  [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=20201]Sa'at[/url] has been dispatched and is currently inside.  The data we have gathered from his correspondence is that the Infinite Dragonflight are once again attempting to alter time.  Could it be that the opening of the [url=http://www.wowwiki.com/Dark_Portal]Dark Portal[/url] is being targeted for sabotage?  Let us hope not...\
\
Follow me, please.  [i]<The Custodian leads you to the closed timeway with the wrecked ships in front of it.>[/i]\
\
This timeway is currently collapsing.  What that may hold for the past, present and future is currently unknown...\
\
The timeways are currently ranked in order from least catastrophic to most catastrophic.  Note that they are all classified as catastrophic, meaning that any single one of these timeways collapsing would mean that your world would end.  We only classify them in such a way so that the heroes and adventurers that are sent here know which timeway best suits their abilities.\
\
Follow me, please. [i]<The Custodian leads you to the entrance of the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3606]Mount Hyjal[/url] timeway.>[/i]\
\
All we know of this timeway is that it leads to Mount Hyjal.  The Infinite Dragonflight have gone to great lengths to prevent our involvement.  We know next to nothing, mortal.  [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=19935]Soridormi[/url] is currently attempting to break through the timeway's defenses but has thus far been unsuccessful.  You might be our only hope of breaking through and resolving the conflict.\
\
Follow me, please. [i]<The Custodian leads you back to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=19932]Andormu[/url].>[/i]\
\
Our time is at an end <name>.  I would wish you luck, if such a thing existed.\

Not to mention the regular leather which sells very very nicely.",
    "110168893311887282007/05/23 22:28:22soulstoneI have found you can also skin the hides from the Nethermine Ravagers and the Nethermine Bursters",

This one is for skinners.  There are variations for miners and herbalists, as well.\
It's a little mis-leading, with the reference to the crystal formations, as I've yet to find any flayers outside of the mine south of the fel orc camp where you pick up the quest.\
Drop rate for the hides is...eh.  Got 25 in about 2 hours; need 35 for the turn in.  250 rep per turn-in.\
Definetly pick up the nethermine crystals quest (for the same rep grind) before you head to the mine, as they crystals drop relatively frequently from all the creatures inside.",
    "110169480111916292007/05/31 14:46:42sildarathIt also drops occasionally from the Black Blood of Dranei (in groups of 4--also the Nethercite Ore and the Netherdust Pollen). \
\
The drop rate has gotten somewhat better, but it's still frustrating to talk to miners who are vendoring their excess Nethercite ore because they've got so much of it (not sure exactly why they'd do that, since they can save it for the next day's quest...)",
    "110168947810894782007/05/24 11:32:22sildarathThis is a very frustrating quest, and makes me wish I'd had the foresight to take mining or herbalism (since both seem easier). I killed a whole bunch of flayers last night inside the mine and only got *one* hide. It seems a bit unfair that herbies and miners can just locate nodes but skinners get screwed with such a lousy drop rate. It's especially annoying (though I'm sure fully intended) that one can't get one's non-Netherwing-seeking friends to help out, since the peons in the mine are all green to me but red to anybody who isn't on the quest line.\
\
I'll try the ravagers and bursters as suggested--maybe the drop rate on those will be better.",
    "110168872840887282007/05/23 18:05:49soulstoneNethermine Flayer Hides are skinned from the Nethermine Flayers located within the Netherwing mines. There are two entrances into the mine, though both entrance paths join together in the mines. While in the mines keep your eyes peeled for glowing Netherwing eggs\
\
Entrance 1: 65.2 90.2\
Entrance 2: 62.9 87.9\
\
The Flayers are located towards the back of the mine, when you enter, follow the mine cart tracks on the left and you will eventually come to a junction in the tracks, you can stay left to find a few flayers, or go right and follow the track that loops north, into the main area full of dead miners and flayers.\
\
Also, kill the blood of draenor mobs as they drop encrusted objects that can be opened that can sometimes contain flayer hides, netherdust pollen, and other stuff that's mostly useless.\
\
For skinners the drop rate of the hide is quite low, my average rate was roughly 12-18%, sometimes in the 20's if I was lucky. On the plus side flayers drop plenty of Netherwing crystals and the occasional Netherwing egg along with cloth and coin.",

\
you can skin flayers that other players killed, but it still takes a bit longer to get all 35 hides than the 40 crystals or the 15 flayer/ravager kills. all in all, you should be able to complete those 4 quests in under 50 minutes. \

during this time you should also find 1-3 netherwing eggs for this quest\

Wait for the trap to dissipate on its own. Concussive Shot it to force it to attack you with lightning again. Lay down a new freezing trap when it reaches you. Move away. Etc.\
\
With just freezing trap and concussive shot (no pet), and a sizeable stack of bandages, you can get all your shots from a single snake. The main advantage to my technique is that it requires no talents or addons, and you have 100% control over the monster, all the time.",

which leads directly into\
6. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10649]The Book of Fel Names[/url]\
\
Now it's time for a venture into the Shadow Labyrinth to kill [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=18667]Blackheart[/url]!  Once that's done that and his body has been looted for the book, it's back to Altruis where again the chains diverge depending on your allegiance.\

    "106401561271001561272007/09/21 09:48:37SihmmThis is part of the [b]Aldor[/b] version of the [b]Book of Fel Names[/b] chain.  As well as reputation with your chosen faction, if you complete it you can choose from:\
[url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31013]Ceremonial Kris[/url] (+heal dagger)\
[url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31010]Slayer's Axe[/url] (2H +str axe)\

[url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31009]Wildcaller[/url] (feral staff)\
\
As with the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10707]Medallion of Karabor[/url] line, this chain starts different depending on whether you're Aldor (A) or Scryer (S).  All the quests are rated level 70 - though the chain is available at level 68, it sends you to the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3789]Shadow Labyrinth[/url] to kill [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=18667]Blackheart[/url], which you might want to hold off on until level 70.\
\
[b]Aldors[/b] pick it up from [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21860]Exarch Onaala[/url] at the Altar of Sha'tar:\
1. (A) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10587]Karabor Training Grounds[/url]\
2. (A) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10637]A Necessary Distraction[/url]\
3. (A) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10640]Altruis[/url]\
\
[b]Scryers[/b] need to visit [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21954]Larissa Sunstrike[/url] at the Sanctum of the Stars:\
1. (S) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10687]Karabor Training Grounds[/url]\
2. (S) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10688]A Necessary Distraction[/url]\
3. (S) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10689]Altruis[/url]\
\
Here the chains converge on your old friend [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=18417]Altruis the Sufferer[/url] in Nagrand.  He gives out three quests that need to be completed (in any order) before you can continue:\
4a. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10641]Against the Legion[/url] - Netherstorm\
4b. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10668]Against the Illidari[/url] - Shadowmoon Valley\
4c. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10669]Against All Odds[/url] - Zangarmarsh\
Having gone around the world killing stuff, you can now return to Altruis and receive:\
5. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10646]Illidan's Pupil[/url]\
which leads directly into\
6. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10649]The Book of Fel Names[/url]\
\
Now it's time for a venture into the Shadow Labyrinth to kill [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=18667]Blackheart[/url]!  Once that's done that and his body has been looted for the book, it's back to Altruis where again the chains diverge depending on your allegiance.\
\
[b]Aldor[/b]:\
7. (A) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10650]Return to the Aldor[/url] - back to Altar of Sha'tar\
8. (A) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10651]Varedis Must Be Stopped[/url]\
\
[b]Scryer[/b]:\
7. (S) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10691]Return to the Scryers[/url] - back to Sanctum of Stars\
8. (S) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10692]Varedis Must Be Stopped[/url]\
\
Varedis Must Be Stopped is the final part.  It's a 5-man group quest that sends you to the terrace outside the Black Temple to kill four elites: [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21178]Varedis[/url], [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21164]Netharel[/url], [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21168]Theras[/url] and [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21171]Alandien[/url].  Look them up  for co-ordinates and tips on killing them - they're pretty straightforward, really.\
\
When they're dead it's a simple matter of returning to the questgiver to choose a prize.",

I'd run in, throw the rock, and aggro all 2-3 of the mobs. Drop stoneclaw, frostshock one for aggro.\

\
As the quest dialogue suggests, you need to finish this chain http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10227 and have killed Levixus.  Having done so, you've completed the quest that allows you to see ghosts in Nagrand and Terokkar.   Greatfather Aldrimus is a ghost, so he can't be seen without having completed this step.\
\
HOWEVER, apparently the potion you consumed doesn't allow you to see into the spirit world 100% of the time (not sure if this is a bug or intended).  This ability seems to take effect spontaneously, and you'll see an icon above your head and hear a sound effect identical to being the target of mind vision, though there is no visable buff indicator or text in your combat log.  After this effect happens, you should be able to see the greatfather.\
\
I'm not sure if you can manually turn this ability on somehow, but i seem to receive it when i move from one zone to another- so when greatfather wasn't visable to me, i simply hearthed to Shat, and ran back to the bone wastes.  Soon after leaving shat i was granted the sight. Problem solved.",

\
My favorite tactic is dive bombing. Fly high and choose a target. Dive down, almost right on top of the target, ready to drop the bomb as soon as you're in range. Dodge flack with q and e. Usually if you aim a little to the right or left of the target initially, the gun will fire a burst just before you're in range, then simply strafe towards the target, dodging the flack. \
\
Once you drop the bomb turn around (I use the mouse) and fly straight up. Use the left button to orient the camera down so you can see the guns firing behind you. Again use q and e to dodge flack that approaches from behind. Once your bomb is about 50-75% cooled down, turn around and bomb another. \
\
This quest is a 1000 times easier if you have help, or if other people are doing the quest at the same time. The guns will be busy shooting at everyone, not just you. Also, the targets respawn after 10-15s, so even with several people in the area, it's easy to knock it out quickly.",

Fly in at about the height of the demons heads so you dont aggro the dragon above, then go right up to just so you can see the cannons arrows. Have your bombs in your hotbar ready and swoop down on top of one. Hit your bomb as soon as it comes into range then immediately fly back up (Holding jump button).

    "11023104129301041292007/06/14 07:27:26SangriliaThis quest is easy as long as you keep the flak cannons confused. I read the comments for this quest, and was prepared for some difficult stunt flying, but it's easier than you think.\
\
First of all, make sure that you first check out the camp and pick your target from the distance. When you picked a target, you can bee-line towards it. You might think it is dangerous, but I did it even with cannon piles flanked by two cannons, and I was never hit. IMPORTANT: make sure you fly towards a spot on the ground on the line between you and the cannon pile, and occasionally press the 'space' button, to do a short climb. This will confuse the guns. If you pick targets at the edge of the camp, chances are the flaks won't fire before you dropped the bomb.\
\
With this method you can use the mouse to move the targeting mark on the ground, and left click to release the bomb. You fly towards the target pressing 'W', and press 'space' occasionally. When you are close enough, the marker is green and it is on a cannon ball pile, press the left mouse button, and IMMEDIATELY turn around, and start climbing, or simply fly erratically. Keep flying erratically while you are moving away to prepare for the next run.\
\
I used this method during my bombing runs, and never got hit. It may or may not work for you, but if you have not already picked a method that works for you, you might consider trying it.\
\
I even tried it on targets inside the camp, and managed to destroy them without getting a single hit.",
    "110239254150925412007/05/28 14:41:50DarkharmonyI'm sure most people have found their own way to do this quest and for those without a epic mount I have found that coming in from the left side of Camp Wrath to be the easiest. Coming in from the left side usually only has one or maybe two cannons shooting at you. \
\
This is usually how I have done this quest. Prior to your approach line up and then click the bomb. On your approach if you hit the space bar to move up and also your q and e it tends to confuse the cannons and you should be able to get in without getting hit. What I mean by confuse is that this way the cannons won't fire all at one spot so you should have less chance of being hit. As soon as you click to drop the bomb immediately turn swing around and fly back to the side. Don't forget to continue confusing the cannon on your way out. \
\
Then just find another one and rinse repeat. Once you get the hang of it you shouldn't have any problem with getting hit. It took me a little while to find what worked best for me. So I hope someone finds this information useful.",
    "110239897110989712007/06/05 21:03:53KurimuJust do circles (press E or Q and adjust with D and A respectively) and click the bombs on the stacks when your cooldown's up.  The cannons only hit you when you're still, so move constantly, and you'll be OK.\

This is coming from an epic mount perspective.",
    "11023126951201269512007/07/26 02:58:35DrelfThis might work for a non epic mount, but my tip works exceptionally well for those with an epic.\
\
PROBLEM 1: Continually knocked off mount when trying to bomb\
SOLUTION: Attack vertically instead of horizontally\
\
PROBLEM 2: Hard to aim as you get closer to target\
SOLUTION: Attack vertically and the target doesn't move\
\
METHOD:\
\
SETTING UP\
1. Get as high a possible\
2. Bind the bomb to a key you can use easily\
3. Change window settings so that you can see objects as far away as possible\
4. Zoom using mouse roller so that you're in first person mode (i.e. can't see mount)\
5. With this method, you should always be facing directly downwards.\
\
BOMBING:\
The whole run will be done in one motion - NO STOPPING. This constant motion ensures you don't get hit.\
1. Hold down right mouse button and face directly down (you should be up as high as possible to start with)\
2. Ensure during the bomb you don't press left mount button and stop\
3. Press Num Lock - you should be heading directly down towards the target\
4. Hold right mount button and move slightly to adjust yourself towards the target\
5. Press bound key for bomb and highlight target - it should be red because you're not close enough\
6. When green, drop bomb and immediately press space bar - you should be shooting straight back up into air\
\
Okay - bomb successful..... keep on going up, but as you do keep an eye on the next target and also keep an eye on cool down\
\
7. When cool down is roughly 4-5 seconds, release space bar - you should be heading down again\
8. Using Right mouse button and mouse movement you should be able to slightly adjust to next target\
9. Repeat from point 5 above\
\
In a neat little addition to this, I get my party members to hop on their land mounts (they don't get hit if on land mounts) and scout around targets. I use adjust slightly towards them as I continue to monitor mini map and their dots. This way I can bomb quickly, and everyone gets credit.\
\
This method is similar to bobbing for apples. Just an up and down motion - very easy.",

\
Pick your target and dive in anywhere at about a 45* angle, release the bomb when in range, do 90* upwards and then circle back out of range. No dodging back forth upward etc, just that simple pattern and once you get it pat down, you'll not only have a 100% success rate ... you'll feel like you're on an honest to goodness dive bombing mission.\

Therefore, every time you see a cannon fire, change your direction and you'll be fine. You have 3 dimensions to work with, which makes it very easy. I have a 100% success rate with a non-epic mount just using this strategy.",

Although it is somewhat funny to conduct 'land' bombings, it's not really viable in the long run, for obvious reasons. I found doing windrunner's method (i.e the 'dive-bombing action movie method) most effective for me. FYI, I'm doing this on my trust [Blue Windrider] so it should be effective for most people. Naturally a sizable amount of strafing is involved as well. Listening to the sounds of the fel cannons firing then abruptly changing direction is my method, and although I've been shot down a couple of times by cannons behind me, I haven't died just yet.",

    "11023128125101281252007/07/28 07:00:08thevenomThis is kind of interesting for prot warriors:\
\
As a prot warrior I love these quests since farming is annoying. However, on this quest I get shot down and lose a lot of HP. When you get shot down, the dot ticks for a percentage of your hp- I have over 15k unbuffed.\
\
When I get shot down, that's a lot of eating. The dot ticks for about 850. I found myself spending a LOT of time eating on this quest.\
\
Then I got naked and the dot ticks for 250. If I get shot down, I get back on my mount and my low spirit can handle that, or eating is very fast.\
\
So my suggestion is to get naked, and watch where you are flying so you don't get knocked into mobs- and if you do, I hope intimidating shout is up!\
\
OR, another suggestion is you can bind your bomb and mount keys, and quickly mount, bomb, and dismount. After some practice they won't even shoot at you. You just have to be quick about it.",
    "11023103248201032482007/06/12 18:05:15kjpodsiaThe one thing you need to avoid doing on this mission is to use the same path to escape the target as you did to approach it.  Specifically, this means, do not use down (X) to attack the target if you're going to use up (space) to escape.  If you do, you risk getting nailed while ascending by flak aimed at your descent path.\
\
A better approach is one like windrunner suggests above.  Aim the camera at your target and use forward (W) to dive/approach.  Then you can use up (space) to escape and stand a much better chance of avoiding the flak.\
\
Note that you can fly high enough to get out of cannon range without worrying about the dragons -- they don't patrol the forge camps.  So fly high between runs and plot the next attack trajectory at your leisure.",

\
1) Fly low and directly at your targeted cannons.\
\
2) Have the bomb clicked and hold the mouse over the cannons as you dive in.\
\
3) As soon as it becomes green, click to release bomb.\
\
4) As soon as you've clicked, veer left or right immediately - do not wait for the bomb to be thrown.\

5) Fly in the new direction for 2-3 seconds then veer away again.\

And yeah he showed as 10195HP to me as well.

When you first attack a mob if you have never attacked that particular kind of mob, at that particulat lvl they will always show low hp, and work their way up to the actual HP as the mod does its calculating.",

\
Kalithresh hits your tank fast and hard, you will need a skilled healer. He is surrounded by aqauriums or small tanks with water, which he starts to draw energy from, one at the time.\
\
You need to destroy the aqaurium as fast as possible once he started to draw energy from it, nuke with everything youve got.\
\
If you fail to destroy the tank, Kalithresh will get doubled attack power and attack speed, and the fight will be uncontrollable.",
    "976353339131255882007/03/18 19:16:33decker12Quick recap of the strategy posted above:\
\
Have tank pull him towards one of the aquariums, and fight him there. The boss will soon start a channel spell on the aquarium, which will transform into a yellow \"mob\" so you can attack it.\
\
Have EVERYONE start DPS'ing down the aquarium, healer included. The boss will still be smacking away at the tank, but if everyone doesn't immediately stop what they were casting/doing and start knocking down that aquarium, it's most likely a wipe because of the buff that the boss gets. With good focus fire you should be able to \"kill\" the aquarium with 1 or 2 seconds left on Kalithresh's channel spell.\
\
After 1 Aquarium is down, the tank moves the boss to the next aquarium, guaranteeing that when it's channel time, he'll channel on the nearest aquarium so the group doesn't have to chase him around the room. Repeat until the boss is dead - it should take a decent group 3 or 4 aquariums worth.\
\
Again it's imperative that everyone stops what they're doing when the channel starts, tank and healer included, and immediately begin DPS'ing the aquariums.",

\
BUT: using keys for this rep quest might be a mistake you'll regret later.  The other quest that opens up with the keys is to get the  [The Eye of Haramad] to summon an extra boss in heroic Mana Tombs.  The item you need to turn in to get the key is only a 20% drop and each attempt requires 5x of the little keys of make the big one.  If you plan on doing the later quests, I'd save 15 keys for later rather than use them all for rep.\

IMO: give/sell extra keys to someone working on rep or the follow up quests for  [The Eye of Haramad].",

In other words, it makes more sense to use Firewing Signets (which you can farm much faster) to get to Honored, and save all of your Sunfury Signets for the grind from Honored to Exalted.\

Takes ~10 minutes before they go away, so sit back and find something else to do or chat for a bit if you have several groups attempting him in a row",
    "105886430291248752007/04/09 09:21:01gp79Also, the order of quests is earth/fire, then water, then air",
    "1058838573130385732007/02/19 07:40:05SihmmCyrukh's primary attacks are physical, meaning they can be mitigated by armor.  With 20k armor, he was hitting for between 600 and 1300.  He also has a ~1.2k knock away that reduces aggro on the target knocked away, and a ~3k trample that hits anyone in melee range.  His final ability is a targeted AoE ignite (fire-based) that ignites an area of ground around a player.  The AoE damage can be minimised by spreading out so only one person gets hit at a time, and by moving quickly out of the ignited area when it does hit.\
\
In my experience, having a well-geared tank hold aggro on him is far more reliable than trying to let the NPCs tank him.  It was also my experience that losing aggro to a knock-away caused Cyrukh to focus on one of the NPCs rather than my group mates, but don't rely on it!",
    "10588248752150248752007/01/26 07:11:03CombineYou start the quest near 42,45.\
\
1. Use totems on the fire and earth elementals surrounding the immediate area.\
2. Use totems on air elementals near Netherwing Fields. 62,57\
3. Use totems on water elementals near 47,22\
\
Then you go up north to talk to the NPC.  54,23\
\
He then asks you to use a whistle on whipper tubers.  Note:  A boar must be alive and near for it to work.  They tubers are around 52,20\
\
Then He asks you to destroy some eggs,  They are just north of him down the cliff.\
\
Once you have done those two quests he will ask you to find his 3 Sons.\
\
The sons are located...\
 \
\
Artor: 30,50\
Will ask you to slay the main mistress which is up the stairs and to the right.  Then you will have to grind those demons to find a quest item.  Then you will have to escort a NPC up the hill.  Once up the hill the NPC will summon a non elite you must kill.   Loot that mob and your 1/3rd done.\
\
Gromtor: 45,24\
Talk to him and he will ask you to find something.  The item you need is locked randomly in a chest that the naga hold.  Go kill some naga and they will randomly drop keys.  Open the chests and eventually youll get the quest item.\
\
Borak: 47,57\
Asks you to do a multitude of things.  The confusing ones involve finding an egg.  Which there are some located in the bird people village just near the NPC.  It will take quite some tries to find the correct one.  He should then ask you to bring it to someone in Shattarah.  \
Also you will end up having to kill some blood elves Eclipse point for armor scraps.  Then you will use a Blood ELf disguise to infiltrate the camp.  Talk to the big guy at the back of camp.  Careful the firehawk beasts see threw the disguise and if you get knocked out of it you must return to the SOn to get a new costume.\
\
Then he will ask you to kill an Elite.  This elite is 61 and can be killed with a tank, healer, and dps.  Once you kill this Dual Thunderfury badass you fight his pet.  Although the item you need is on the guy.\
\
After killing this guy return to the son.  Then return with all 3 of the quests completed to the father at 54,23. \
Rewards from this part are:\

http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30925\
http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30944\
\
He will then tell you to fight the big green golemagg. \
\
Using the stone of damnation head to 45,46 (the place you started with the purple aura).  Using the stone at the altar will spawn the boss, and the 3 Sons will fly in to help.  Talk to them when ready and they will begin the fight.  NOTE: These 3 sons will tank the boss  pretty well as long as you dont pull aggro to early.  The boss is a straight forward fight.  You basically need to do 300k damage in a few minutes before the NPC's die, otherwise you'll end up tanking.  Can be done with a decent 5man group.\
\
Rewards from killing this guy are pretty sweet...\

While the Ravager egg roundup quest itself says you have to go all the way to Terokkar Forest to collect them. The drop rates from the skitterers are probably very small as far as the eggs are concerned..but still if you had both quests and if you do the ravager quest 1st, why not have a use for the skitterers, because you will end up killing a few to get to the ravagers.",

Also, they're colored differently than the ravagers -- they're mostly blue while the ravagers are a uniform drab green.\

\
I developed a strategy for each of the mobs:\
\
Slayers) Pull them one-by-one at the front gate, or Cyclone them, shift into cat form, wait for your energy to build, then take them on. Usually respawns come so you don't have to hunt around for all 8. Of course, watch for the 70 elite. Mangled them up, rake 'em for DoT, and then ferocious bite for a kill. Found out this was much easier than just straight Mangle-Ferocious Bite combo.\
\
Darkweavers) Easy to kill, just fly to a ledge where you see one and make sure they aren't charging a champion at the time. Pounce, mangle, mangle, bite, dead. Keep in mind there are some in corners that sitting and aren't doing anything. If a Champion aggros you, get your back away from the ledge! He'll send you flying over and then you'll aggro elites and slayers below.\
\
Champions) Fly high up to the top of the Terrace where you see the last set of steps. Lots of Champs there, just perch near the mountain and aggro them one by one. You get 6 this way, and you may have gotten 2 from killing Darkweavers. Respawns come fast anyway.",

    "10816164788101647882007/10/08 15:15:31NaenthosDidn't find this quest as annoying as others apparently do. If you want to solo this keep in mind the following:\
\
-Use flight form or a flying mount to look for a nice starting spot. Stealth shouldn't be necessary if you find a good spot or two (I think).\
\
-All the single groups (single Darkweavers, Chosen, pairs of Slayers) are very much soloable at level 70. The elites are probably not.\
\
-Darkweavers: They run. Slow them, trap them or kill them quickly.. that and/or kill surrounding mobs first to give a bit of space.\
\
-Chosen: Beware for patrolling Chosen. They are much nastier than Slayers. They have a pushback, so make sure you don't get pushed over a ledge.\
\
-Slayers: Can be pulled solo if you pull ranged (not necessary in most situations and may not be desirable.. because..).\
\
-Respawn rate is fairly high for the time needed, given all the patrols and such. That also means you can just look for a few spots close together and go between those.\
\
-Drakonids/Eyes: Drakonids are probably best avoided. Make sure you learn where they patrol and how long they take. Eyes are much less of an issue as they have low hit points, but best kill them (for me a single starfire does the trick) if you can do so without much trouble.",

It's even worse than the nearby \"Tablets of Baa'ri\", which was bad enough.

Everytime you turn around there's another mob bearing down on you, or an elite patrol. \
\
This quest isn't part of a necessary chain and I can pretty much guarantee that your repair and potion bills will cost *far* more than the rewards.  If you feel you *must* do it, bring a couple friends.\

\
The slayers are pretty easy though, you can get them at the entrance near the elite aldor/scryer troops and no one should have an issue. I found flying to 72,38 and killing the darkweavers/chosen from there (there's 6 chosen around a staircase which is a good start), was a good way.\

We did have one elite Drakonid wander up there, but the two of us (70 holy priest and 70 MM hunter) were able to kill it without much problem. \

Confirmed that the Slayers are still buggy and sporadically reset, but we went down to the ramp leading up from the center road (66, 42) and just pulled the Slayers one by one leading up that path. Much easier than killing on the platforms, and no resets there.",

\
I went here and discovered they removed the Repair spell.\

This was in fact one of the good solo quests. Not too easy but not too hard. Now, it's a pain to do it. You can't solo it, or if you do, it's really harder. We need to be three to do it, but it went well.\

\
1. Put a freezing (slowing) trap slightly up the road towards Area 52.\
2. Take control of the pet robot, wait for the reaver to appear, target him and spam the bot's slam attack as to grab aggro immediately when the reaver turns hostile.\
3. Run back behind your trap and shoot the reaver.  If you've placed the trap far enough up the road this will despawn your mechanical pet and the reaver will aggro you.\
4. Call your own pet now.  You can use it to temporarily distract the reaver if it gets too close to you/starts hitting you.  It will also allow you to feign death once without having the reaver reset.  He will pwn your pet quickly but it allows you to get some distance.\
5. Run towards Area 52, lay a second freezing trap along the way.  Sometimes the reaver will not even trigger the trap because he's ran past it before the 2 second trap delay is over.  Make sure you keep aggro on the reaver (shooting him once with Arcane Shot was enough in my case).\
6. Shortly before I entered Area 52 I had to pop a health potion as not to die.  Your mileage may vary.\
7. If you get the Area 52 guards to aggro the reaver you're pretty much sorted.  If you die your ghost will spawn directly in front of the town gates, just run back in and res.  The reaver will still be there, fighting the guards.  Keep assisting them.  As has been correctly mentioned above, the goblin \"guards\" (Netherstorm Agents) will not help you, but the two elite ogres in front of the Arena vendor building will.  So make sure you get the reaver into their aggro range.  Feign Death as soon as you see them aggroing the reaver.\
\
Optionally you can use speed buffing measures (nifty stopwatch, swiftness potion, even cheetah aspect), your mileage may vary here.  If the freezing traps trigger and you use your pet/FD ability smartly it is possible to get to Area 52 without any speed boosts, however.\
\
The reaver killed at least two guards, and two players who jumped in to help.  All in all, it was pretty priceless to watch him cause havoc in the town while shooting him from behind.\
\
Highly recommended ;-).",

Negatron is tauntable. Use the robot's smash ability whenever available (every 10 sec), and when he gets aggro, taunt Negatron back off him.\

If you get low health, let the pet tank (let him get a few smashes in and dont taunt) so you can bandage up (wait til right after an earthquake to bandage).\
\
Remember to keep demo shout and thunderclap on Negatron, keep him fully sundered of course, and the pet can benefit from battle shout.\
\
I was able to solo it without needing to health pot (i think i bandaged 2 times) or shield wall or last stand, but i did not do this quest as a fresh 70. If youre taking a lot of damage, use your first health pot early and let the pet tank when needed for bandaging. You may be able to get a 2nd health pot in, and if it's really close at the end, shield wall and last stand.",

To avoid this, I used Smash first thing to get aggro on the robot, then ran away to approximately 30 yards and started firing away. I kept Hunters Mark and Scorpid Sting up the entire fight. I also used Misdirection + Distracting Shot onto the felreaver pet to make sure I never pulled aggro. Between 30-35 yards away is the \"Sweet spot\" where Negatron will not charge you and you will be unaffected by the earthquake. By the way, try not to go out of 35 yard range because everytime I did that the pet despawned and Negatron came after me. Good luck.",

Overall not a difficult thing, Smash (The aggro/damage ability) is very nice to use at the start of the fight, at least a few times to build up aggro. However, i dont think Slam is as useless as some people make it out to be. To ease the pain of healing this robot, I used the slam to interupt Negatron's channeled ability, Earthquake. It seemed to help.\
\
The other thing to be aware of, is the seeming glitch with Negatron. He seemed at first that my hunter had pulled aggro, because Negatron started advancing towards her, But aggro was still on the Scrap Reaver. Negatron just kept sliding at her, which was a pain in the ass due to the range factor needed as a hunter.\
\
Lastly, If your healing the Reaver (Since the Heal function has been removed) always check to make sure he isnt \"Devastated\" when you do so. It's Icon is the same as Mortal strike, and the effect is simmilar (75% Reduced effect from healing).\

An opposite faction mage did throw a couple of fireballs at Negatron the third time.\

Tree druid, spamming lifebloom and rejuvenation and the robot's damage ability, with the occasional swiftmend and regrowth. Also burned innervate and a mana pot.\
\
The reason I had to do it three times is that the first two I didn't do any damage to Negatron, so I didn't get quest credit. The third time I did a couple of moonfires (one early, one at the very end) and I got credit for the kill.\

\
Materials Needed: Swiftness Potion.\
\
*Note: I'd say health potion but the swiftness pot kills the CD. <3\
\
Start the quest, When u start it, throw up frost shield... Back up to the torch right next to the road.  Then spam ur pet attack button so that ur pet moves to Negatron the second he pops aggressive.  Let the pet smack him a bit, then using Ice Lance, you hit em once or twice.  \
\
*Note:  Ice Lance is a low DPS insta cast spell, I use it to create LOW hate.  You'll see why in a minute.\
\
Then stun negatron with the pet, and start bookin towards Area 52.  Make sure, however, you make sure to ice lance when u think you might deagro the guy.   To assist with that, JUST to make sure, I pulled out my water elemental.  Also, if negatron got too close early, since my ice lances are so low DPS, and my pets hit pretty hard, my pet would pull him in the opposite direction giving me more head start.  Between your travels from the initiating the quest, to Area 52, you'll notice negatron is one fast motha fu<ka.  So when u think hes getting  kinda close for comfort, pop that swiftness pot.  It will put u to a running speed, I thought, was the same speed (%50) or a TINY bit faster... I don't know, I didn't care... He was fast, so i got fast.  \
\
Upon entering the town, you are NOT out of the clear.  The guards who are \"Agents\" as the last part of their names, will NOT help you... So don't hang out around them thinking they will... It is the Brusiers that run in to smack megatron. SO, I ran through the doorway closest to the Gryphon master (Still had swiftness up) Forward, then taking an immediate left across the bridge that heads to the engineering supplier, agroing the brusiers around me... (CONTINUE  ICE LANCING AS NEEDED, YOU CAN LOSE AGRO EVEN WITH BRUISERS BASHING HIM!) Then i continued into almost a square by taking a right running to the other bridge. \
\
**Note Somewhere in town between the agroing the guards and going across the OTHER bridge  to the inn, i Ice blocked... When i ice blocked, I allowed the bruisers to get agro, so i stayed Blocked the full duration**\
\
Now if you're lucky, as I was, Allies AND horde in town see this going on and are like \"DAMN I WANT TO KILLZ THE BOT!!!!\"  And help you out...If not, well, you got cold snap, Ice barrier, and Ice block with the water elemental for a short distraction to keep ya goin.  Just keep agroing all the bruisers u can, cus he swats em down.  GL\
\
*NOTE: Used Ice Lance btw if you didnt catch it, because it does low dps, and causes the lowest amount of threat while i was moving, needed to make it easy for the guards to pull hate off me.*",

Solo'd tonight as a shadow priest however.  Reasonably well geared, about +750 shadow damage.  I was able to just spam the pets smash ability every time the cooldown was up, while at the same time DPSing the reaver like I would any normal mob - SW:P, VE, VT, Mind blast and mind flays.  The vampiric healing kept the little reaver up, though I finished the fight with only 5/100 hp left on him and had to use a mana pot as the fight was pretty long.",
    "10248546862054682006/12/03 20:49:13InfinityXThis has to be one of the most interesting solo quests in the Burning Crusade.\
\
When you start the quest, Doctor Vomisa gives you the Scrap Reaver Controller. When used, you'll gain the Scrap Reaver X6000 under your control, just like a hunter or warlock pet (not direct control, like Mind Control). The Scrap Reaver has three abilities at your disposal. All three abilities are on a linked 10 second cooldown. One ability is a two second stun, which isn't nearly as useful as the other 2 abilities in almost all situations. The second ability is called \"Smash\" (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=34618). It deals a large amount of instant damage, and causes a very large amount of threat, as the tooltip describes. You should use this as soon as the fight starts to be sure you or any allies you have helping you do not get aggro from Negatron. He hits extremely hard and should only be tanked by the Scrap Reaver. The Reaver's last ability is a self-heal, named \"Repair\" (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=34619). It heals 10,000 damage over 10 seconds (1000 per second), regardless of the odd/buggy tooltip. This ability should be used early, and not as a last resort after your Reaver is low on health. Be aware that Negatron has a 75% healing effect reduction ability called \"Demolish.\" Try to time your repairs when your Reaver is not afflicted by Demolish.\
\
This quest will take a few tries, so don't get frustrated if you aren't able to complete it at first. It's a decent challenge, but just be patient and get a feel for when to use your Reaver's abilities. Be sure not to walk too far away from Vomisa's console, or you'll lose control of the Scrap Reaver and Negatron will make a beeline to you, and he is much faster than players on foot.",

Put scrap reaver on the boss and run to about 30 yard range, where you will be out of range of the earthquake and charge abilities, then spam heals on the scrap reaver.\
\
Make sure to deal some damage to the boss so you get kill credit, and use your scrap reaver's smash ability every cooldown as it is your primary damage. It will be a long fight but very doable as any healing class.\
\
BTW, this boss is a mini Doomwalker. He has the same earthquake and charge abilities that Doomwalker has, but has a mortal strike instead of sunder armor. Have fun.",

\
Blue Equipment, with Frozen Shadoweave set on. Affliction Spec\
\
As the fight starts, Negatron immediately aggros your pet. I opened with a Smash, and kept repeating Smash as often as the cooldowns let me.\
\
Smash has a 10 Second cooldown.\
\
I popped Immolate, Unstable Affliction, Curse of Agony, Corruption, and Siphon Life. ~9.5 seconds worth of spells.\
\
Then I went onto to Heal my pet the way that warlocks do, which is a 10 second channel. I popped Smash as soon as the Heal started, and again after it ended.\
\
Rinse and Repeat. Usually I wait until my DoT's have run thier course before I re-cast. With the Exception of Siphon Life, I didn't bother this fight. You're going to be almost constantly channeling health into your pet, so you don't want to interrupt your cast to reapply dots. Negatron WILL eventually win via attrition this way, so you have to do as much fast damage as you can.\
\
An additional note. You should always keep your pet in between you and Negatron. The reason for this is your pet healing spell has a low range in comparison to everything else. If you are too close to Negatron trying to heal your pet, you will get interrupted with the Earthquake spell that occurs, and be stunned for several seconds. \

It was a very close fight, with my pet on its last sliver of health before Negatron finally bit it.",

    "10612139322201393222007/08/17 04:00:09RainfallThis quest is an obvious tribute to the movie \"[b]The Fast and the Furious[/b]\".\
But besides it's name I've noticed some more connections with the movie.\
\
The movie, as we all know, is about people [i]driving[/i] fast and powerful cars. During the quest players also \"[/i]drive[/i]\" (gain control, literally) a powerful Fel Reaver Sentinel unit and it's sprint-like ability makes it fast as well.\
\
Fel Reaver Sentinel as every other Fel Reaver have exhaust pipes so we can assume that it has [i]internal-combustion engine[/i] just like most modern cars we see in the movie.\
\
Every internal-combustion engine utilizes some kind of fuel but again Fel Reavers are so big that using gasoline would be damn too expensive and most likely they use a [i]diesel[/i] oil (probably some fel-version of it) which gives us connection with the main star of the movie [i]Vin Diesel[/i].\

And even though all those things I've said can be just speculations there is at least one unarguable connection - both protagonists of the Q and the movie - Fel Reaver Sentinel and Vin's character - are totally [i]bald[/i]!",

Affliction Warlock - DPS and AoE.\
\
jef3189's write-up is an excellent guide, so rather than rehash that, I will note some things that helped our group finally down the Raven God.\
\
-According to our warrior, the cyclone spell is *NOT* pummelable, so don't count on that to stop it.\
\
-For the druid doing statue duty, it is highly recommended to create three macros that will automatically target and cast either Rejuvenation(Rank 1) or Regrowth(Rank 1) on them. This will eliminate the need to find the statues amongst the chaos, and your spells if not hot-keyed. The statues are named Hawk Spirit, Falcon Spirit, and Eagle Spirit. For example:\
\
/target Hawk Spirit\
/cast Rejuvenation(Rank 1)\
\
-Spell Bomb will ruin your day if you're not paying attention. For the druid spamming statues, it's extremely easy to get hit multiple times before you realize what's happening. The effect only applies when the spell lands, however, so spells with longer cast times can be timed to land just after the debuff fades.\
\
-This one may be obvious, but a cycloned target is immune to everything. Don't bother to heal or innervate someone in a cyclone, for example. This could be very easy to miss if you have debuff filtering enabled.\
\
We fought Anzu in the room where you summon him, and so had to deal with the adds as well. It was a hectic fight, but once we had our strategy down, no one died. The guild members were all on Ventrilo, the warlock was not. However, with a little practice, Anzu should be a fairly straight-forward encounter. He dropped http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32779 for us.\
\
The fight was frustrating, but can be fun once you work the kinks out. The spells and bird adds, while inconvenient, are not make-or-break unless you have a string of bad luck, so even groups with a less than \"optimal\" makeup should give it a go.",

Had myself, feral druid tank, rogue, elem shaman, and a mage.  I made macros to regrowth each statue, which made things MUCH easier imo.  I would simply toss some hots on the tank, do a round on each statue, then head back to the tank for 20 seconds.  I find it much simpler to use regrowth over rejuv, because of the extra 9 seconds.  The banish phase seemed very simple, I barely saw anyone's health move at all during the time, even the aoeing mage.

The fight was too difficult for our resto druid to solo-heal, so I (a feral druid) put on my healing gear and played as a secondary healer. Keeping HoTs on the statues was my priority, and throwing occasional HoTs and decurses on party members was secondary. We had a warrior tank and two frost mages. The fight can be rather long, and I chugged at least three Major Combat Mana Potions (I gave my Innervate to the main healer).",
    "1100188753480887532007/05/23 18:32:34jef3189This is a fairly difficult boss in my opinion and here is a good setup for the boss:\
\
Raid Composition:\
----------------------------\
-AOE class, preferably a mage (for counterspell on the cyclone)\
-A resto druid to OFF heal (so that he can keep up the mini statues, explained in a sec)\
-A priest to main heal (for shackles throughout the instance)\
-A tank (either a feral druid/warrior)\
-A Marks hunter (for silencing shot to interrupt his cycone)/ Rogue to kick\
-----------------------------\
\
Boss Abilities:\
----------------------------\
Charge - He randomly charges a party member for about 1k\
Spell Bomb - He will put spell bomb on a caster in the raid. If the caster does a damage or healing spell, it will cost them 1k life and 2k mana, knocking them back.\
Cyclone - (INTERRUPTABLE) He will cyclone a party member for 8-10 seconds. (Curse of tongues may help, this is sort of like shadow power/charged fist in heroic mech and should be interrupted as often as possible)\
Paralyzing Screech - AOE Stun that will stun everyone for 5 seconds, this is what wiped us half of the time. Be SURE the tank has full hitpoints before the screech, which you will see him casting. This ability is similar to \"time lapse\" for chromaggus, and the tank needs to be topped off before this so he can survive until the healer comes out of stun.\
\
Finally, @ around 66% and 33% he will \"banish\" himself becoming immune to everything and about 10 birds will swoop in and circle the party. This is where a mage comes in very handy for frost nova. They will move around constantly, and each bird has near 12k hitpoints, so freezing them in place will help with AOEing them down. BE SURE you kill them as soon as possible because after about 1 minute the boss will come out of his \"banished\" form and continue his attacking the party.\
\
**There are three statues of birds around the room that will come alive when activated by a druid's \"Heal Over Time\" (HoT). Usually you will need a druid backup healing anyway, so have him keep these birds up by using RANK 1 Rejuvenation and  RANK 1 Regrowth.\
\
General Strategy:\
------------------------\
You MUST have a two healers for this fight, it's nearly impossible to do this without a backup healer mainly because if the main healer is cycloned or spell bombed, the off healer (usually the druid keeping up the statues of the birds) needs to pick up heals on the tank. \
\
Have your rogue/mage/hunter/shaman (if he is on DPS) interrupt the cyclones as often as possible. A cyclones healer and spell bombed off healer in combination with paralyzing screech is a most definite wipe situation.\
\
It take a lot of coordination, and would not recommend \"Pugging\" , unless you have everyone on comms or unless they know exactly what to do. \
\
**Note you need to clear the ENTIRE room before attempting the boss.\
\
If I missed anything make sure you post it below. Good luck druids.\

He is mainly a tank and spank boss except at around 66 and 33%.  There are 3 bird statues that spawn when he spawns, a Falcon, Hawk, and Eagle.  When he reaches both 66% and 33% he spawns a group of birds, so bring to life the eagle statue that does about 300 dmg a sec.  In between these percents, keep to life any of the statues you want.  To do this I suggest the druid(s) make macros to cast Rank 1 Rejuv on whatever statue.  After the 2nd group of birds, just dps him down and collect your rewards.  Have fun.",

Kiting:  Clear out the area around you.  You can clear in a clockwise circle.  When he casts to throw boulders, you should start nuking him.\

Hunters:  What I did was I present a freezing trap a bit in front of me (icecube one), opened the chamber and had my pet tank for a bit.  He died and took about 600-800 per hit (I'm Marksmanship spec).  So what I did affter my pet died was started to kite him into traps.  I would wait for him to be trapped at the full duration (npcs aren't affected by diminishing returns) then once trap wears off, I would put a concussive shot and nuked him.  By the time he gets close to you, your scattershot and trap cd should be ready and scatter and trap.  Run to another side and rinse and repeat a few times.  When he was trapped, I got out of combat without fd'ing.  I was able to med by doing a cycle of bandaging then eating/drinking.\

    "103096625850662582007/04/12 19:45:50qhiiyrSolo'd as a 70 frost mage (19/0/42). The first time I died with the reaver only having about 800 health left. The second time I died way earlier because I used my only health pot the first time.\
\
The third time, I didn't actually have to use any pots, or even cooldowns (besides water elemental). When the first guy came, I backed up to the tent where the questgiver is and threw my water elemental on the mob, then went to continue DPS on the reaver.\
\
When my elemental was at about 25% health and I figured he would lose the battle alone, I helped him finish off that first mob, then continued DPS on the reaver, with him helping. Second mob comes, I sheep him. Continued DPS. Third mob comes, put water elemental on him.\
\
By the time the fourth came, the reaver was pretty low, maybe around 20% max, and I was near full health. Right behind the fourth came the fifth, sixth and seventh mobs, so I just kept ice barrier'ing and frost nova'ing to give me time to finish off the reaver.\
\
Not sure why the successful time was so much easier than the unsuccessful ones, but it might have something to do with backing up to the tent; I think it stalled some of the adds.\
\
As a side note, if you leave combat at all on this quest, the reaver disappears.",

I basically ignored the adds, while putting all my damage out on the Fel Reaver, popping one mana pot and using Shadowfiend to gain additional mana back. Fear and PW: Shield basically allowed me to get the adds off my back while concentrating on the Reaver. It was a close call, but it's certainly doable. So unless you have a way of tanking the adds, just focus on your main target.",

I shielded for the first add and used fear for the 2nd one, and they never came back from that fear - after \"killing\" the reaver the adds must disappear.\

\
If the reaver's body isn't showing for you, try this...\
1 - Start the event, and wait until you have at least one ambusher aggroed.\
2 - Run away (I think it was to the NW that had the least mobs) until the ambusher(s) reset from range.\
3 - Go back to the Reaver, wait.  The bodiless name will show up again after a short while, and then vanish.  Wait a bit more and the actual body will spawn.",

Sheeped the first add and summoned the elemental immediately, did my best to burn down the Fel Reaver while keeping the adds controlled (which sometimes meant having them chase me while the elemental beat on the reaver, and sometimes me killing an add or two to avoid getting overwhelmed). It took pretty much every single cooldown I had - mana gems, mana potions, healing potions, Gift of the Naaru, bandages, elemental, cold snap, frost nova, ice barrier, etcetera, etcetera. Was very close at times, and took quite some time (going by cooldowns: elemental, cold snap, elemental, elemental twice more and by the end I could've used cold snap again if I'd needed to).\

[url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31013]Ceremonial Kris[/url] (+heal dagger)\

\
As with the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10707]Medallion of Karabor[/url] line, this chain starts different depending on whether you're Aldor (A) or Scryer (S).  All the quests are rated level 70 - though the chain is available at level 68, it sends you to the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3789]Shadow Labyrinth[/url] to kill [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=18667]Blackheart[/url], which you might want to hold off on until level 70.\

3. (S) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10689]Altruis[/url]\
\
Here the chains converge on your old friend [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=18417]Altruis the Sufferer[/url] in Nagrand.  He gives out three quests that need to be completed (in any order) before you can continue:\
4a. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10641]Against the Legion[/url] - Netherstorm\
4b. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10668]Against the Illidari[/url] - Shadowmoon Valley\
4c. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10669]Against All Odds[/url] - Zangarmarsh\
Having gone around the world killing stuff, you can now return to Altruis and receive:\
5. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10646]Illidan's Pupil[/url]\
which leads directly into\
6. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10649]The Book of Fel Names[/url]\
\
Now it's time for a venture into the Shadow Labyrinth to kill [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=18667]Blackheart[/url]!  Once that's done that and his body has been looted for the book, it's back to Altruis where again the chains diverge depending on your allegiance.\
\
[b]Aldor[/b]:\
7. (A) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10650]Return to the Aldor[/url] - back to Altar of Sha'tar\
8. (A) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10651]Varedis Must Be Stopped[/url]\
\
[b]Scryer[/b]:\
7. (S) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10691]Return to the Scryers[/url] - back to Sanctum of Stars\
8. (S) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10692]Varedis Must Be Stopped[/url]\
\
Varedis Must Be Stopped is the final part.  It's a 5-man group quest that sends you to the terrace outside the Black Temple to kill four elites: [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21178]Varedis[/url], [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21164]Netharel[/url], [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21168]Theras[/url] and [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21171]Alandien[/url].  Look them up  for co-ordinates and tips on killing them - they're pretty straightforward, really.\
\
When they're dead it's a simple matter of returning to the questgiver to choose a prize.",

He will resist a lot. So reapply vampiric embrace as much as possible because it wore out on me sometimes and I almost died. I used two super mana pots and a shadowfiend though I could have done it with just 1 mana pot. The shadowfiend will also get extra damage and your mana bar will fill in just a few hits.\
\
Clear the mobs around the throne so you can get maximum fighting space. I only cleared the path leading to the platform, but it didn't work out so well... I eventually ended up on the edge of the island kiting him back and forth. Don't kite him too far at the start or he'll deaggro, just kite him back and forth between his casts. He'll occasionally knock you back which makes things easier (or harder if he knocks you somewhere you don't want to be). As for his anti-magic shield you should be running as soon as he casts that to let some of the time wear off on it, but for the most part you just need to tank his damage for awhile and heal back up with VE.\

I'm a Frosty mage and Scryer, and my guildy was a DemoLock and Aldor. What we did was he initiated his quest first, which brings in the help of some Draenei support. They do not show up as aligned to Aldor and do not attack Scryer aligned players.\

The Draenei went through a story event, pausing for a short fight with a traitor (part of their story and harder than Socrethar actually). After that, and some more yipyap (it does take a while, just wait), the actual fight with Socrethar begins. We let the Draenei initiate. I used Vorenthals Presence, and the Draenei basically tanked the entire fight while we DPS'd. Less than 2min later, he was dead.

He does not do any special attacks or anything just like Boldwyn said above and the spriest was able to very easily heal the tank. He went down pretty easy and we went on our way. One thing that I would like to add is that we fought down the hill a bit from the 72 elite and only had to kill 4 flayers or so to clear the path. \

During the bosses, on the 6, 12, and 18th wave - We all ignored the dragons and nuked the boss - after the boss was dead one of us used the beacon to kill the remaining adds.\

The Rogue and Shaman burned down the elite Rift Keepers, while the mage took care of the assassins.  Also the Rift Keepers do reset if you drag them to far from the portals, and I beleive that the Rifts are on a timer so if you take to long on 1 Rift Keeper another portal will spawn no matter what. \
Soemthing to note if you fail or wipe during the event and Medivh dies then you can not complete the quest, and you will have to reset the instance in order to complete the quest.  Have an order planed out on who will be poping their Chrono-becon at what ever time.  If you can save one for the 2nd and the last boss you will have no problem with either of them.

\
Strategy\
\
As you enter the instance you will encounter three types of mobs (Spiders, Crocs, and Stealthed Cats) and all of these mobs are non-elites. As you move forward in the instance you will see Medivh surrounded by a red casting effect. The event will start the minute you get near Medivh, so avoid him until your group has cleared a good distance around Medivh of all three types of mobs. This gives you and your party room to move safely about during the event.\
\
Once cleared of crocs, spiders, and cats make sure you are full-buffed and have your consumeables ready. Move close to Medivh to start the event. On the top center of your screen you will see a percentage of remaining shield left on Medivh and a Rift Status Counter. Your objective is to keep Medivh's shield from reaching zero percent and destroy what comes through each of the 18 Rifts. \
\
Rift 1/18 will spawn somewhere in the woods surrounding Medivh. First, an elite Rift Keeper will come out and channel a spell near the Rift to keep it open. As long as the Rift Keeper is alive, the Rift stays open. As long as the rift stays open, more non-elite dragonflight will spawn from the Rift and head towards Medivh. One person in your party is to crowd control the non-elites and prevent them from hitting Medivh. Your main tank is always on the Rift Keeper until it dies. The Rift Keeper is channeling, mind you, so your party moves to each Rift as they spawn and tanks them there. Slay the Rift Keeper and finish the non-elites. There is time to drink between each Rift if you do this efficiently and quickly. \
\
Each Rift will spawn somewhere in the woods surrounding Medivh. Rinse repeat with the elite Rift Keeper and non-elites.\
\
However, there will be Bosses on Rift number 6, 12, and finally Rift 18. Non-elites will continue to spawn from the rifts as these are open so continue preventing them from reaching Medivh. After each boss kill there is a significantly longer time to res dead, drink, or prepare.\
\
Boss explanation\
\
1st Boss - Casts a magical slowing debuff (dispellable). Aoe knockback. Spank and tank.\
2nd Boss - Puts a debuff on your main tank (much like Kurinaxx) that reduces healing effects by 10% each stack. Obviously, this is a very heavy dps fight so you burn him as fast as possible. This is the only time when your crowdcontrol does not crowdcontrol and instead does damage to the boss. \
3rd Boss - Hits like a truck and uses Time Stop (Much like Chromaggus). If you are a healer, you will get time-stopped and your tank will drop health fast. Shielding when time-stop wears off is efficient and as are HoT's (Heal over Time [renew, rejuv, regrowth]). No non-elites come out of the 18th Rift so your crowdcontrol should be dps'ing. \
\
After the 3rd boss is down, you are done with Black Morass. Talk to Medivh, complete your quest, and get your Karazhan key. Good luck.",

We wiped on the 10th rift. Wiped again on the 8th rift.\
\
Second group: Warlock, hunter, warrior, full-resto spec'd druid, druid tank.\
We wiped on the 12th rift at the boss. We then stuck to the plan of \"Ignore the adds and put all dps on the boss, then when the boss is dead, use a guardian.\"  And it worked perfectly.\
\
Then we got to the 18th rift, and for this one, you'll need a GREAT healer.  At times, my meter went so low you couldn't see any green that I had, but my healer healed me as quickly as freakin' possible. And we made it. :D\

\
Yes, as a feral druid your weapon skill does not increase while in bear or kitty form, but there is a reason for that.  It doesn't have to.  As a feral druid there is no reason to level up your 2h mace skill (or staff skill if that is your weapon of choice), except boredom,  because it has no reflection on your hit rating or anything else while shape-shifted (see http://www.wowwiki.com/Druid  [b]\"Weapon skill with the equipped weapon has no effect. Instead, the natural weapons always have the maximum weapon skill for their level. Natural weapon skill can be increased through the feral combat skill, as seen on the Earthwarden\"[/b]) .  When you shift into bear or kitty form as a druid, you gain what is known as feral combat skill, which is always maxed out for your level, and the only benefit that you get from a weapon is the stats that are on it.  +weapon damage enchants (i.e Striking) or chance to proc enchants (i.e. Firey, Icy, mongoose etc) do nothing for you.  Hope this helps out the above poster and anyone else considering a feral druid.  \
\
If you would like my opinion, go with Agamaggan's Quill  http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29911 which is from a very easy quest when you first get to Outlands, or go through Hellfire Ramparts repeatedly to get Ursol's Claw (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24155)  Either one will take you several levels till you can get \"Staff of Beasts\" (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=25761) from a quest chain in Nagrand called \"The Ring Of Blood\" at 65.  Again, hope this helps out and have fun",

\
As of 2.1, there is a bug involving swapping your Violet Signet for a second time, given that you are alternating between three types of signets (which is entirely possible if you are a Druid, Shaman, Paladin, or clicked the wrong ring when you were first given a choice): if this is the second time you swap your Signet type, the game will think you currently have the ring that you originally picked when you hit Friendly reputation. This will cause you to get the wrong quest, which will ask for you to return that original, first ring, and not the one you currently have - so you can't swap your ring.\
\
For example (as in my case), if a character picks the Archmage ring, then later wants to switch to the Restorer ring, and later wants the Protector ring, they will be stuck with the Restorer ring, because Archmage Leryda will be asking for you to turn in the Archmage ring that does not exist.\
\
There is a simple fix to this, however - destroy your current ring, and talk to Archmage Leryda, and she will restore your first ring. This is verified by GMs; if you'd rather see for yourself, and you don't mind the four hour wait you can open a ticket and ask them yourselves.\
\
Just thought I'd like to help people who have this problem, because it sure confused me for quite a while, and had me digging in my bank for twenty minutes.",

As with the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10707]Medallion of Karabor[/url] line, this chain starts different depending on whether you're Aldor (A) or Scryer (S).  All the quests are rated level 70 - though the chain is available at level 68, it sends you to the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3789]Shadow Labyrinth[/url] to kill [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=18667]Blackheart[/url], which you might want to hold off on until level 70.\

Here the chains converge on your old friend [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=18417]Altruis the Sufferer[/url] in Nagrand.  He gives out three quests that need to be completed (in any order) before you can continue:\
4a. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10641]Against the Legion[/url] - Netherstorm\

Varedis Must Be Stopped is the final part.

For melee classes : \

    "10320212450102124502008/01/03 20:49:34jojodamunkyA 70 Resto Shaman can easily solo Naberius. Here's how I did it:\
\
Step 1: Like several others have mentioned, I cleared out the adds that are in the chapel with him. They didn't link with Naberius.\
\
Step 2: Ate and drank to full hp and mana. Then I entered into the chapel and dropped a mana spring totem and a grounding totem. Then I cast a Lightning bolt on him. While he started casting his frostbolt, I dropped an earth elemental totem.\
\
Step 3: After the grounding totem absorbed the frostbolt, I cast Earth Shield on the Elemental and then dropped a Wrath of Air totem (the one that gives you extra spell damage). \
\
Step 4: From here on it was incredibly simple; the Earth Elemental was an excellent tank. Dropped a searing totem and just took him down. I took him down by throwing flame shock on him and then shooting lightning bolt after lightning bolt at him. Don't think I ever even needed to heal my elemental but make sure it doesn't die. \
\
I believe at the end of the fight my elemental had more than 90% hp and I didn't lose any. For all those shaman who didn't know (not many of you, but their may be a few), the Earth Elemental you get at level 66 is excellent for \"soloing\" those 2-3 man group quests. Although I probably could have tanked him myself by throwing up Earth Shield on myself and then using melee, shocks, and fire totems to take him down, why do extra work when you don't have to?",

    "10320155844201558442007/09/20 19:17:48SlimdaAt first I tried that \"LoS\"-thing, but found out, after two almost-deaths (Flight form really helps when falling off the edge), that that wasn't possible.\
\
So... I cleared the churched and outside the entrance, I /cursed the Lich, shifted into kitten and snuck up. I dealt some swift blows, granting me five combo-points, gave him a Ferocious Bite, popped into Bear and spanked away. I had to jump in a circle every now and then 'cause he spawned those portals of his. Works like tanking the dragon in Ramparts, actually. Just move out of the \"zone\". Anyway, halfway through I was low on health, popped out of bear right after a frost-bot, chucked up a Regrowth, on with Barkskin and up with Healing Touch. After that, I had full health and a nice HoT. Back into bear and kill the thing. Easy tank'n'spank, really!\
\
Summary: Kitten, 5 combo, Bam! Bear, spank, heal, spank, /dance.",
    "1032034560900345602007/02/12 08:18:09ParynI was able to solo this with very minimal support, as a 70 shadow priest. There was a friendly tauren druid who would cast moonfire or starfire on Naberius, but that was towards the end of the fight.\
\
Here is a synopsis of the strategy I used:\
\
Naberius: \"Grr, I'm going to cast frostbolt on you\"\
Player: \"I'm going to duck around the corner.\"\
Naberius: \"Gosh I can't see you anymore. Let me run after you.\"\
Player: \"I came back out from the corner!\"\
Naberius: \"Grr, let me cast frostbolt on you again.\"\
\
Here is the strategy I used in more detail:\
\
Clear the area surrounding the church of any ghosts. Then clear the inside of the chapel of the two stationary ghosts. Like people have mentioned in previous comments, Naberius will use frostbot as a primary attack. He needs a few seconds to cast this, of course. So what you do, is mindflay or renew any dots you want to use while he is casting, then quickly move out of line of sight from the frostbolt. This will cause him to stop casting, and move after you. Once he does this, move back out into his line of sight. He will again try to frostbolt you. Mindflay, or wand, whichever you prefer. Then before he finishes casting, move out again. \
\
I used the chapel as a means to escape line of sight from Naberius by moving around corners just as he was finishing frostbolt. \
\
Oh, and if you see the red diagram under your feet, move out of the way. \
\
You could probably solo this as a lower level shadow priest. The strength is in the strategy and execution.",

\
If you follow the edge of the mountains to the N/NW, you will start to encounter domesticated pigs.  Soon you will come across tubers, with more frequency as you drift N/NE.  The pigs in this area are alive and well and it is a good place to farm for tubers.\
\
I went here as a level 70 healadin - and my DPS is not much.  Generally speaking, I allowed the pigs and the thrashers fight and would step in and draw aggro from the pig.  This accelerated my DPS as the pig continued to fight the mob.  I would find areas with several tubers and no pigs - I would kill the thrashers and wait for the pigs to respawn if necessary.  All in all, it was 25 minute quest.\
\
The pigs that spawn dead appear in the area where the eggs are on the ground.  This is bad place to hunt tubers.  The purpose of the pig corpses is to make the mobs move unpredictably as the flayers will sometimes rush and attack a pig corpse.  Havesting an egg near a corpse can sometimes cause multiple mobs to attack, so keep this in mind.",

OK, off of soapbox now.  Thanks for the comments of using the whistle on a tuber mound with no boars near it to make it respawn in another location.   That helped tons when I did the quest, so many tuber mounds were no where near where the boars were spawning.

I did this quest about four days ago. There's one location where there will usually always be around four boars, no flayers. Two boars came up to sniff the mound when I blew the whistle, but only one root spawned.\

Usually Felboars spawn near the tubers if you wait about a min.  If you don't see any Felboars spawn near the tubers I suggest you respawn the tubers using the whistle.\

\
1) To make it easier on yourself, and to increase the amount of harvestable roots from 1 tubber mount, what your wanna do first of all is scout out the area - find a location that has alot of mounds within close proximity of eachother.\
\
2) Start killing the flayers in the area you've chosen. Kill them as fast as possible and keep this up until you have a fair amount of domesticated boar spawns (say 5-7 or more).\
TIP! The more boarspawns in the area the more will come when you whistle, thus creating severel harvestable roots out of 1 mound.\
\
3) When the area runs out of tubber mounds, scout a new area and start over :)",

Thanks for helpful tips above",
    "105146998841566992007/04/20 07:54:48AxehiltFarmbuyer's post is just outright incorrect info:\
\
* Line of sight didn't prevent a pig from digging a mound for me. Then again, hills don't normally block line of sight anyway (ie you can cast spells through terrain most of the time.)\
\
* Flayers don't have \"gigantic aggro radius\". They have normal aggro behavior. This means they have the normal radius for targets their level, and an increased radius against targets lower than them. As a level 70 mob this means they have a pretty high radius against the level 65 pigs, but a normal radius against a level 70 player. They also patrol small distances, which increases the likelihood of aggroing if you're unwary.\
\
Other observations from my 2nd time doing the quest (took ~20 mins like the first time):\
\
* If 3+ flayers are in the area and a pig tries to spawn, it will spawn dead. Dead pigs don't even give you the option of saving them. This is bad. Solve the problem by clearing the area of flayers - then pigs will spawn alive.\
\
* Try to be strategic about which pigs you keep alive. I was able to get 3 tubers in one whistle blow because all 3 pigs were within the radius when I blew it. This is fairly luck-based, but also a result of my keeping those pigs alive in an area where there were tubers. (which really sums up the whole quest: keep pigs alive in an area where there are tubers.)",

\
The only real difficulty in this is finding a spawn that is near a felboar, and also keeping the felboars alive because the Ravenous Flayers all around the are are constantly killing the boars.\
\
Note: aggroing one of the felboars to make it follow you and then using the whistle while standing on a tuber, Does NOT work, just means you have to kill the felboar, which is pointless.",

    "1051431129130311292007/02/05 08:07:15chonchuThis is not a hard quest if you understand exactly what you need to do. It took me 15min to finish it.\
Near the NPC you gonna find some \"Ravenous Flayer\" a dark mob with big claws. Their roll is just kill all \"Domisticated Felboars\" they can find around. The \"felboars\" roll is respond to the Whistle you have when you use it next to a Shadowmoon Tuber Mound. The Shadowmoon Tuber Mound roll (lol) is get digged by the felboar and gives you a Tuber itself (the quest item) and your roll is keep the Boars alive.\
All resumes to: \
1- Find a mound. Once you found one check if theres a noar near it (the range on the whistle is pretty short... i can say 10~15years tops). If the boar is close enought use the whistle. The boar will come, dig it and youÂ´ll be able to loot a Tuber.\
If you donÂ´t have a boar next to it you have 02 options:\
A) Wait 1 or 2 minuts. You have a 90% chance that a felboar will pop right next to it and some Flayers will attack it so you save him and use the whistle. One tip here is clear the area first. Sometimes when the boar pops 02 Flayers come to attack it and they hit hard.\
B) In some spots no Felboars pop at all so you use the whistle. The Mound WILL despawn and respawn around 30sec later in somewhere else.\
\
It all about finding the mounds, wait for a boar, save the ones that are bein attacked next a mound and etc...\
\
Some nice mounds have 02 boars around it so when you use the whistle both come, both dig and you get 02 quest items in a shot.\
\
Its a very patience quest. The Flayers always drop money, and good drop rate on netherweave cloths and gray items cause yes.. you will kill some.",

    "11034157885501578852007/09/24 23:07:19SahrishYou can.\
\
As of 2.1, there is a bug involving swapping your Violet Signet for a second time, given that you are alternating between three types of signets (which is entirely possible if you are a Druid, Shaman, Paladin, or clicked the wrong ring when you were first given a choice): if this is the second time you swap your Signet type, the game will think you currently have the ring that you originally picked when you hit Friendly reputation. This will cause you to get the wrong quest, which will ask for you to return that original, first ring, and not the one you currently have - so you can't swap your ring.\
\
For example (as in my case), if a character picks the Archmage ring, then later wants to switch to the Restorer ring, and later wants the Protector ring, they will be stuck with the Restorer ring, because Archmage Leryda will be asking for you to turn in the Archmage ring that does not exist.\
\
There is a simple fix to this, however - destroy your current ring, and talk to Archmage Leryda, and she will restore your first ring. This is verified by GMs; if you'd rather see for yourself, and you don't mind the four hour wait you can open a ticket and ask them yourselves.\
\
Just thought I'd like to help people who have this problem, because it sure confused me for quite a while, and had me digging in my bank for twenty minutes.",

1. Mobs die faster\

3. You got some backup in case you pull too many mobs or get the humanoids to agro you (the shadowbolt spam is very annoying)\
4. There are less outsiders killing demons, so there's more for you to kill and you finish the quest much faster.\
The only disadvantage -> You dont get the full loot off mobs (as if they drop anything worth it...)\

    "1087932132550321322007/02/07 08:35:51TheUzAbout the Encounter:\
It is important to note that you have a limited area in which you are allowed to fight.  If you walk too far from the quest giver you will fail the quest.  This means limited kiting.  I would say you should try to stay within a 20 yard radius of the quest giver.   This is a multiple wave event and you will have 5-10 seconds of rest between each wave.\
\
The Opponents:\
\
There are 4 waves of enemies:\
\
Wave 1:\
2 Birds 1300-1700 health â Melee attacks for 350-700 on 0-1k armor\
Wave 2:\
 2 Birds 1300-1700 health â Melee attacks for 350-700 on 0-1k armor\
Wave 3:\
 3 Birds 1300-1700 health â Melee attacks for 350-700 on 0-1k armor\
Wave 4:\
 1 Bird 10k-12k health â Melee attacks for 1200-2500 on 0-1k armor\
This bird also has a pushback ability with about 2 seconds of cast time.\
The pushback does no damage\
Multiple pushbacks can lead you far enough from the quest giver to fail the quest\
\
My Experience:\
I soloed this quest as an elemental mage at 70.  I would rate the encounter as moderately difficult because of the limited area in which to fight.  Still, I would strongly suggest that this quest be done in a group.\
\
I was able to use all of my crowd control abilities including Polymorph, Blast Wave, Frost Nova, Frost Bolt, and Cone of Cold.  Having cold snap with three ice barriers made a huge difference as well.  I fought him with 6800 health (add 3 ice barriers for nearly 10k).  I did pop a potion mid battle but it turned out to be unnecessary, his attacks while very large were not fast enough to make his DPS as scary as his crits.\
\
I would suggest that any mage who wants to fight him solo open on him with a polymorph to prep a larger damage spell as an opener.\
\
Be prepared that all CC seems to break about 50% quicker on the big bird.  Expect 6-9 seconds on Polymorph, and 5 seconds on Frost Nova.",
    "10879106242501062422007/06/17 23:39:41ZiirSoloed this as a 68 affliction warlock so I didn't have Felguard like the one above me. Took me a few tries but it was easy when I figured it out.\
\
It hasn't been mentioned yet but the waves are timed. That means the next wave and the avatar WILL spawn whether or not you've cleared the previous wave.\
\
Before the fight, have a healthstone and voidwalker. Yes, I know he sucks but you need him for the shield. Having netherweave bandages are very helpful as well.\
\
On the first wave, send voidwalker to one of the birds and just dot it with corruption and then drain tank the other bird. They die fast so don't bother with UA, just corruption and CoA was enough. The drain tanked one will die fast and just as you are finishing off the other, the next wave should spawn.\
\
Again, same tatics. On this wave, I couldn't kill off the second bird because I wasn't as fast about it as the first time, so when the third wave spawned I have three at full health and one nearly dead.\
\
They hit kinda hard for having such low hp, so I instant HoT the four and the low health one died. Stick corruption on all three and then I feared one, voidwalker on another and drained the last. Voidwalker was nearly dead so I sac'd him.\
\
Then the avatar spawned so I feared him. DC one bird, shadowburn the other and drained the last one down and healthstoned. Feared avatar again and hit it with corruption and bandaged myself to life tap cause I was low on mana. Then from there on it was just simple fear and dot.\
\
It was challenging but it's also a great example of being able to use all of your skills to beat an encounter. As you can kinda tell, I panicked when I had the avatar spawn and three birds coming towards me so I did what I could to burn them down asap.",

\
- Master of Elixirs is an Alchemy profession specialisation (remember you are stuck with the one you choose) you can learn by completing the quest \"Master of Elixirs\" given by Lorokeem at Shattrath's Lower City (45.7 , 21.1)\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10902\
\
- Master of Elixirs will create 0 - 4 extra elixirs\
\
- It is active for ALL Elixirs and will proc for flasks as well (lucky me had a 5x crit on Flask of Supreme Power)\
\
- The Proc rate seems variable (my total average was 18,71%) As it seems there is a lower proc rate for the low level Elixirs (lvl 5-200 had a 12.85%) with a higher proc rate for the high end elixirs and flasks (27.40%)\
\
- Master of Elixirs only activates \"discovery\" but does not increase the probability with Elixirs.\
\
- You need to be 325 in Alchemy and at least lvl 68 to obtain the quest (all that say otherwise: add a screenshot or it didn't happen...) To be able to do the quest yourself you surely need to be 345 in Alchemy since that's the level for Elixir of Major Defense.",

Today, I discovered something extremely cool: When you drop a mastery (such as Transmute Mastery) and relevel alchemy all the way back up... once you're at 325 alchemy, talk to Lorokeem in Shattrath City and just ASK him to become Elixir Master and he'll do it for you. No quest needed at all.

Proc rate is 20%+ so crazy not to spec into one. Just a matter of asking yourself what you make the most of.\
\
The description says all high level elixirs (meaning outland recipies) but I have also had this proc while making Mongoose Elixirs and also made a bunch of Ogre Strength's but never got a proc off them. So looks like high-level pre-BC recipies still proc along with but not all.\
\
As an important note and often asked question, speccing into a Mastery does not increase your chances of getting a 'Discovery*' in that catergory of alchemy. For example become an elixir master doesn't increase you odds any of discovering* Flask of the Relentless anymore then an transmute master.\
\
*Discoveries as they are called refer to a new dynamic implemented in BC. There are a handfull of recipes (transmute, elixir and potion) that can only be learned by an alchemist discovering them while crafting. There is no item created so discoveries can not be sold or traded. In addition the proc rate of a discovery is random and very low, less then .05% so discovered recipies can not be farmed in theory.",

If you move back in front of the mob and it multishots, you will have the flightmaster and the gryphons beat it down with no problem.  I kept an ice barrier and a mana shield up at all times.

As was mentioned before, if you have mobs on you, run over to the 70 elite guards and when mobs multishot they'll aggro the guard.  If you can, stay close so that more multishots will keep the guard in combat.  Run back behind the fence to bandage.  If you have aggro on several mobs, they'll stand still behind the wall, unable to shoot because of LoS.  This helps reduce the number of mobs the quest npcs have to deal with until you drop out of combat.  Needed to bandage twice and eat once, as well as use Last Stand and A Potion, but made it through w/o being killed.

When you get aggro, run back towards one of the guards.  Use small heals on yourself and wait until the dragonriders fires multi-shot.

It's hit and miss if you'll succeed or fail depending on how many NPC's die before the timer runs out, but if you position yourself near the wall and take down one mob at a time you've got a decent chance of completing it. If not, just wait for the NPC to respawn and start it again. You can run behind the tall wall by the flightmaster to go out of combat and drink/eat, but you will occasionally get mobs who follow you there depending on their position at the time. Also, as mentioned, if you get multi-shotted the guards will usually get hit and run out to take down the mob. I never had to try it more than 3 times to get it done, but I also didn't have a huge amount of control over the lifespan of the NPC's. Inevitably they will die too soon and the quest will fail, other times they'll survive almost to the end, it just depends.\

Considering that at exalted you can get the key that allows you to summon the mana-tomb boss without consuming it, it's probably a good idea to stick to this part of the rep grind until you're close to exalted.\

IMHO thes elites for this q are very worth grinding for these rings they are an excelent marriage of stats and resistance, although it may take an age for you to get one to your liking and due to the BoP nature of them doing them in a group of many different classes my get you the one you want quicker.\

Just to see, I did this quest again, got the key on the 10th mob or so, and got Porfus the Gem Gorger, a giant basilisk model. Same level 71, and just like the Fiend model, he wasn't kitable via frost spells, but had low enough HP to burn down easily.\

In both cases, the mob I freed dropped a green as well as the ID tag. \

\
The keys drop from most if not all the ethereum mobs around Manaforge Ultris and from the Zaxxis mobs near Manaforge B'naar. The drop rate is low but if you circle the Manaforge killing these and come across a Jailor then the drop rate is 100% from him. The jailors it would seem are on the same respawn as the other mobs so keep killing, I have had 3 jailors spawn at the same time by killing the other mobs but can fly around looking for hours without a jailor if I havn't been killing the other mobs.\
When you open a prison orb you have the chance of freeing a friendly or a hostile mob. The friendly mob will grant you relevant experience, so far I have had eperience granted for (as a human) The Consortium 550, The lower city, 550 and  Sporegarr 450. You will not get a prison I.D. Tag with these friendly mobs. If you free a hostile mob you will have to fight it. They are lvl 70 or 71 but seem to be easy to kill, you will get a lvl 70 Blue/Green and an I.D. Tag which you hand in to Commander Ameer and get 275 rep with The Consortium, or 250 as non human.\
Once you reach Consortium Revered you will be offered the quest A Thousand Worlds from Ameer.",

\
You must take advantage of the railing on the stairs that is between Alandien and Varedis.  The key feature of it is the rocky formations at one end of it that allows mobs to run up onto the railing structure and the downward stairs at the opposite end of the rocky part.  When you get the demon hunter near the railing with that feature it is possible to kite them back and forth by jumping onto the rail and then down, making the demon hunter run all the way around to reach you.\
Basicly, the stairs that lead towards Varedis from Alandien has a railing that holds three braziers, has an end where mobs can walk onto it and another, downward stair case where you can jump up onto it and thanks to pathing limitations mobs must run around.\
\
Alandien is the easiest as the railing I used is right above her, just shoot her and shes basicly in position.\
\
Netharel is out of reach of this and I happened to luck out when there was a bunch of farmers to the point where I could simply just kite him out the front of the ruins.\
\
Varedis and Theras can be reached by clearing a path towards the railing you use and kiting them to it.\
\
For Varedis it was really tricky as near 50% he becomes invulnerable until the book is used on him, which has like an 10 second cast.

Yep! done today, me (rogue, mutilate spec) with a paladin tank and druid healer, we're mostly in your-average-blue-gear but it was easy really, maybe the tree popped a potion on varedis, but as for the rest he wasn't even bothering healing just meleeing with me :P\
\
Varedis is REALLY easy if you just \"MOVE!!\" when he's about to finish casting his fire spell, thats all ! its a 2.5 sec cast, if u got enemy casting bars shown (in your interface options) then its really easy to notice.\
\
Most of the elites have mana burn, but with about 150 mp/5 on the tree druid this wasnt nearly a problem, rofl. Blessing of Wisdom ftw!\

    "106516264210626422007/04/05 15:41:30ParynI thought I would add my group's experience doing this quest, in case someone might find it useful. Our group make up was hunter, rogue, mage, and druid tank (me). You might notice we are lacking a dedicated healer. \
\
As people have already mentioned, three of the four elites are not very tough. They aren't anything special. The only one that was problematic was Varedis himself. \
\
If you have dps, a druid tank, but no healer, then what you can do is clear out the staircase that leads up to Varedis. When your druid tank gets around half or so health, he jumps straight down next to the foot of the staircase, and that should give him enough time to heal himself. \
\
Then just catch him back on the staircase and bring him back upstairs. \
\
Repeat if necessary. \
\
Oh, and don't forget to use the book of fel names.",
    "1065173611111640492007/04/27 01:20:13CarsoI can verify the above post.  All four of these mobs are soloable using the strategy of exploiting the stair pathing mechanism.  Soloed by a 70 lock, 41/5/15, 1150 spell damage, ~8k hp, ~6.5k mana, used imp pet, no buffs.  Died twice learning the method and mastering the jump.  Died once to accidental trash pulling.  Lost the tap twice learning the timing.\
\
To clarify the above post a bit, you want to use the railing that runs north-south.  It is the first railing above Alandien, to the east.  It is distinguishable by a large mass of rocks on the southern end.  This is the area that the quest mobs will path through to bridge the gap between the \"floor\" and the railing.  It somewhat resembles the masses of rocks and eggs in the spider boss portion of ZG.\
\
All of the quest mobs have a mana burn ability.  I was not able to successfully avoid this by moving out of LoS.  I imagine it would be very difficult if not impossible for any class except hunters and warlocks to use this strategy effectively.  Also take note of the fact that Theras has a spell reflect ability that he uses every 30-45 second - it lasts for approximately 10 seconds, and resembles a blue mana shield.  It does not have a cast time, but makes a distinguishable sound.\
\
For Theras, Alandien, and Varedis, what you want to do is jump from the upper portion of the staircase onto the flat portion of the railing between the far right brazier and the middle brazier.  It's difficult to describe.  I found a good measure was to jump from the second stair on the upper portion of the staircase, with a healthy angle towards the railing.  You're aiming right for the middle of the flat portion.  If you fail mid-fight, it is possible to make a \"straight\" jump from the edge of the railing onto the top of the railing, but it is chancy and more difficult, especially when you're getting hit (and possibly dazed).\
\
I strongly recommend practicing this method on some of the trash nearby before attempting it on a quest mob.  There is definitely a learning curve associated with making the jump.\
\
As a lock, remember to put your imp on stay so that he does not attempt to continue pathing, causing you to continuously lose and regain your stam buff.\
\
It is possible to solo Netharel using this method, but you have to use a different spot.  Netharel has a few points in his path that are near a short staircase leading down.  If you clear the 6 mobs close to this staircase, he can be pulled away from them.  Jump from the short staircase onto the railing.  Netharel will path down the long staircase and around at the bottom.  This path is much longer and seemingly more complex for Netharel to follow, bringing him out of LoS for 5+ seconds.  It's sometimes difficult to maintain the tap.  An affliction lock can handle it with some practice - it may be more difficult for any other ranged class.\
\
Note that Varedis does have to be in LoS to begin using the book, but he does NOT have to be in LoS when the book finishes its cast.  This comes into play because there is a ledge in the railing (where the middle brazier is) that can impede LoS when Varedis is on top of the railing. Knowing ahead of time that you don't have to have LoS when the book finishes can relieve some of the anxiety and you should have plenty of time to bring him out of demon form at 50%.  I found that the best way to use the book was to assign it to a hotkey, wait until he was close to me on the \"ground\" level, then jump onto the railing and immediately use the book - he'll still be in LoS here for a moment before going out of LoS behind the railing, and you can adjust your camera so that you can see him pathing around.\
\
If you need to try the book more than once mid-fight, remember that you can maintain the tap by casting spells even when he goes \"immune\" to spells and abilities.",

    "1102794950170949502007/05/31 20:01:07JaygoodieAll the demons have several unique abilities. Due to the lack of time to alt+tab and write down the exact numbers, i will just explain each one.\
\
All demons have the ability to throw a hammer at the teleporter, dealing damage. Once it gets to a certain damage, the next demon will come out.\
\
Demon one: Felguard.\
\
1) Mortal Strike: Heavy single target damage, 1.5 second global cooldown.\
2) Whirlwind: Hits all enemies in a short range about 4 times, usually enough to kill them, if they all stay in range. 20? second cooldown\
3) Charge: Charges a target like a warrior, stunning it for a brief moment. Once the felguard reaches his target he stomps the ground in a green hellfire, dealing strong AoE damage. 20? second cooldown\
4) Howl of Terror: Instant cast, sends all little demons running away for about 6 seconds. Good to use this if your whirlwind is on cooldown. 30 second cooldown.\
5) Special \"Drain Life\": Drains the life of all nearby opponents, healing you dramaticly. CAUTION: This has no noticable graphic, but if you look at your demon's HP, it will go up. Consumes one Charged Crystal Focus.\
\
Enemies in phase 1:\
 In phase one, the teleporter will summon felhounds that do basic melee damage, and imps that shoot fireballs. Charge the imps whenever possible. Felhounds vary in size / stamina, and have more stamina than the imps. \
\
Demon Two: Dreadlord. \
(Note: this one is from memory, I only played it once, but enough.)\
\
1) Mortal Strike (same as above)\
2) Fel Fire: Emits a non-interupted channeled fire spell in a cone directly in front of you. You can rotate to get all enemies around you, but make sure you dont change your spot. Deals decent damage.\
3) Throw Axe: Throws his axe at a ranged target, dealing heavy melee damage. Good finishing move.\
4) Super Jump: Jumps at a ranged target, stunning all demons around you for 4 seconds. Also deals AoE damage. \
5) Drain Life: (name is incorrect) Hits one RANGED Gan'ark minion  for massive damage, healing you at the same time for alot. \
6) Special \"Lift Off\": (name incorrect again) Dreadlord takes off into the air, not taking any damage. Does a slow circle around the teleporter, the entire time raining fireballs down on all enemies below. INCREDIBLY effective, however it consumes a Charged Crystal Focus, and has a 5 minute cooldown. Save it for when the final boss comes out, or for emergencies only.\
\
Enemies in phase 2: \
In phase 2, you will nolonger get imps and felhounds, but you will get Gan'arks which deal weak melee damage. At about 20%, they run away and start to \"construct\" a fel cannon. This is the time to throw your axe, or super jump, or drain life from it, before it builds the cannon. The cannons are similar to a warlock imp; they dont have alot of HP, but can be very annoying.  With the Gan'arks come \"Driller\" demons (dont know the name, but the ones with welding masks/drills on them). These guys do heavier melee damage, have more HP, and do an acid geyser in front of them, much like many others of their kind do. \
\
Phase 3: I did not survive to phase 3. But the demon came out, it is a \"Shiva\" demon, like the ones to the fel area to the north. \
\
I used up 4 charged crystal focus the entire time. first 3 were used on the felguard, and the last was used on the Dreadlord wayyyy too early on in the fight.\

\
Here's how you can get screwed over:\
1) You have a Darkrune\
2) You did Banish More Demons on a previous day and got an empty Kronk's Grab Bag\
   * Why is it empty? It has a Darkrune in it, but you can't loot it because it's unique.\
   * Why are you hosed? You can't turn in Banish More Demons because you have a Bag, and you can't upgrade your Darkrune because you haven't done Banish More Demons today. Essentially, you lose a shot at the Shartuul event, which you only get on average once every 4 days (if you do BMD every day).\
\
So here's my advice - if you have a Crystalforged Darkrune and you get another Darkrune, do the event that day and then upgrade your rune.",

Some added hints and tips for the last few bosses (if you're having trouble with the first two you won't be able to do it):\
\
-Try to time going back into shadow after a particularly dangerous move (Dark Glare, Incinerate) and also try to time it for about 5 seconds before Siphon life will wear off so you can death blast then reapply it\
\
-For Shartuul, he has a ton of health but he barely does any damage (your siphon life ticks for 2400 but his shadow bolts hit for 3600-ish).  It's possible to not lose any net health at all on this fight if you play it right.",
    "110271103751401103752007/06/24 13:35:20KalkenI've killed Shartuul a few times now, basically farming him for Depleted items whenever I get a Darkrune.\
Here's my strat for getting to and beating Shartuul without help from other players:\
Before beginning, make sure you have at least 5 Charged Crystal Foci.\
\
Demon 1: Felguard\
Very easy fight, if you use a charged foci on this fight, you might not get past the second phase.  Use your hammer whenever it's up, Mortal Strike Single enemies, and abuse Charge.  Charging nearby enemies causes you to run a very short distance and create an AoE that basically clears the area.  Avoid using Whirlwind and if you get overwhelmed use fear.  When the Doomguard comes out begin this sequence: Mortal Strike, Fear, Charge, Mortal Strike, etc.  Hopefully he goes down easy.\
\
Demon 2: Doomguard\
Kind of an easy fight too if you keep an eye on the little guys.  Basically white damage and kill the fight few little guys, they're no issue.  The little guys are just walking healthstones for your Steal Life ability.  Whenever you see a little bugger run off or channeling any spell use your stuns ASAP or it'll make your life harder.  When the big guys spawn use your Super Jump ability to stun them and get in close.  Once he is stunned and you're in melee range use your Punshing Strike to deal a huge amount of damage and dramatically reduce his dps.  Basically just keep them stunned for your punishing strikes.  When the Shivan spawns, use Lift off using up one charged foci.  When you get better at this event you can down her without a Lift off.  Treat her as a Big guy, stun locking her and punishing striking her until she drains life.\
\
Demon 3: Shivan\
\
Stage 1: Eye of Shartuul\
Stay in shadow form and wait for beholder to spawn.  Cast siphon life and shadow nova then go into Flame form.  FLAME BUFFET IS YOUR FRIEND! Stack it constantly casting pyroblast in between CD's.  When he begins casting Dark Glare go into Ice form and ice block.  This will reflect the damage dealing huge damage.  Go shadow form when it CD's and use death blast if Siphon is still up.  Apply another Siphon and go fire.  Repeat until dead.\
\
Stage 2: Hound of Shartuul\
apply Siphon and go fire form.  Spam flame buffet and just kite the dog.  Watch for a debuff on you and cleanse it with the Clensing Flame move of fire form.  Simply kite and use to restore health and he'll die from the flame buffetx 10 pyroblasts.\
\
Stage 3: Shartuul\
Go shadow Form, apply siphon life and shadow nova, go Fire form.  Spam Flame Buffet and watch for debuffs that you MUST cleanse or Shartuul deals a lot more damage.  if he casts incinerate go ice and ice block to reflect it.  Once Flame Buffet is stacked to 10 make sure Siphon Life is still up, if not go shadow and reapply.  Once both debuffs are up, go Ice and run up to him and Frost Nova, then, cast Chaos Strike (the two charged foci move.)  IMMEDIATLEY go Shadow and cast Death Blast.  Bam, you're at full health.  Wash, Rinse, Repeat.  If you run out of foci just spam Pyroblast.\
\
Tips: If you have trouble with shartuul bring a mage or lock as their fire spell recieve the Flame Buffet effect.  My 70 Frost Mage was able to deal 77k fireballs and was actually able to aide in dps.",
    "11027156176111196172007/09/21 11:35:55elillaThat's the answer right there.\
\
The AOE heal is channeled.\
\
Fear - Then heal use the channeled heal.  If something is still hitting you or more then one; kill it first.  If there's more then one mob still hitting you; it's a bad idea.  \
\
Do not wait until you're <50% health to use it.",
    "1102710413121995282007/06/14 07:31:37ClayyBe careful, you can get locked in a circle with this quest. its wise to hand in the dark rune as soon as you get one from 'Banish more demons' reward bag. I didnt and so i had a dark rune in my bags, as well as the reward bag which contained another dark rune. \
\
I couldnt hand in the 'banish more demons' quest because i already had a  reward bag, i couldnt start the 'do you have a dark rune?' quest because i was on 'banish more demons' and i couldnt open the bag because it contained a dark rune......\
\
So after speaking to a GM for quite some time he advises me to drop the 'banish more demons' quest (protection warrior so i cried) and this quest still wasn't availible so in the end he had to alter npc's. So i eventually get the Crystalforged Dark rune and the demon to posses is broken....\
\
so wasted my morning, dropped all the quests and ill do them tomorrow with a clean slate.\
\
IF you are one of the classes where grinding is not your strong point. be careful as i got owned.",
    "1102714145921995282007/08/21 00:22:00TheololHere's my full \"guide\" about this issue:\
\
It surely doesn't work to keep a Darkrune, a Crystalforged Darkune and a Kronk's Grab Bag... If you hold all these and let the daily reset happen, you have basically just lost a shot at the Shartuul event.\
\
So, how to avoid this? Just be aware that you can't hold more than one of each of these 3 unique items, and do the Shartuul event ahead of getting full, or on the same day you got a new bag. Always remember to open the bag when you get it, if you can't, that means you need to do the event as soon as possible, because obviously it has a new Darkrune in it. You need to use your current Crystalforged Darkrune and do the event before the next reset. This will allow you to do the event as well as Crystalforge a new one afterwards, since it all took place the same day.\
\
However, if you have all of them and Gahk doesn't have the \"Yous Have Da Darkrune?\" quest, then you have let the reset go by. In this case you have already lost one darkrune whatever you do, when that happens you should just delete the bag so you can turn-in the \"Banish More Demons\" quest (usually it will be after having the quest done again and returning to the NPCs that you'll realize you already messed up by not having done it the day before). Being able to turn-in this quest is key to being able to Crystalforge a new Darkrune, so just getting rid of the bag is the single thing you need to do. You can also just delete the plain one and open the bag, same results = no bag, Darkrune, Crystalforged Darkrune. Then you can turn-in the quest and receive a new bag as normal.\
\
To be safe, always keep only one Darkrune or none, not both plain and Crystalforged because you might not have time (or remember) to do the event again before the next daily reset.\
\
The reset is at 4:00 EU, but in fact you should always do dailies preferably before 3:00 realm EU, turning in dailies after that time will make them done for the next day as well - this doesn't show right at the reset, but will happen when you log back in hours later, so you can still do them again right after the reset.\
\
Also, there will be a Raw Darkrune ( http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32642 ) item coming in a patch. This will apparently stack up to 20 and work in the same way as a normal Darkrune, 1 for each Shartuul event, therefore different than the Fragments ( http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33784 ), which will also be patched in. It's a quest item, so it's likely for it to come with a new repeatable quest, to allow you to turn it into a normal, unique Darkrune. This will allow you to Crystalforge a lot more than the 2 you currently can each day, so that in theory you can stack up the event 22 times and then do it in a single day... But mainly, it's obviously to prevent people from just losing their Darkrunes when they don't do the event along with the dailies for a couple days at a time.",

10. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10708 [70] Akama's Promise\
\
After you finish this chain, you get to pick from some rewards and the chain seems like it ends. It continues however, inside Serpentshrine Cavern (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3607) from an NPC called Seer Olum (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22820) who you can speak with after killing Fathom-Lord Karathress. He starts the next part of the Black Temple Chain by offering the quest:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10944 [70] The Secret Compromised\
For this quest you just return to Akama.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10946 [70] Ruse of the Ashtongue\
In this quest, you must use the costume Akama provides, and kill A'lar in Tempest Keep: The Eye while wearing the Ashtongue Cowl. Attunement for The Eye is a whole different chain.\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10947 [70] An Artifact From the Past\
In this, you need to gain access to The Battle of Mount Hyjal in Caverns of Time, and slay the first boss, Rage Winterchill. Attunement for this involves killing Lady Vashj and Kael'Thas Sunstrider.\
4. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10948 [70] The Hostage Soul\
For this you must speak with A'dal in Shattrath city.\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10949 [70] Entry into the Black Temple\
For this, just speak with the naaru Xi'ri in front of Black Temple.\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10985 [70] A Distraction for Akama\
Unknown what this quest asks of you, most likely you need to defend Xi'ri and make your way into Black Temple. At the end, you become attuned to enter and are granted The Medallion of Karabor (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32649)\
\
At this point, you are attuned and can enter Black Temple, although the chain continues and you can soon upgrade your medallion. It continues with:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10958 [70] Seek Out the Ashtongue\
You just need to find Seer Kanai (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=23158) inside Black Temple.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10957 [70] Redemption of the Ashtongue\
This involves entering Black Temple, and killing the boss the Shade of Akama (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22841).\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10959 [70] The Fall of the Betrayer\
After killing the Shade of Akama and returning to Seer Kanai, he asks one last thing of you. Kill Illidan The Betrayer. After doing so, you are granted the Blessed Medallion of Karabor, an upgraded version of your original medallion, and allows teleportation to the Black Temple.",

    "1057599019150990192007/06/05 22:30:51WraathThis is a quest involved in the Black Temple Attunement Chain:\
\
The Black Temple attunement starts at The Altar of the Sha'tar for Aldors, and the Sanctum of the Sun for Scryers. Both are in Shadowmoon Valley.\
\
Aldors start attunement from Anchorite Ceyla (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21402) at the Altar of Sha'tar in Shadowmoon Valley:\
1. [A] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10568 [70] Tablets of Baa'ri\
2. [A] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10571 [70] Oronu the Elder\
3. [A] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10574 [70] The Ashtongue Corruptors\
4. [A] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10575 [70] The Warden's Cage\
\
Scyers start attunement from Arcanist Thelis (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21955) at the Sanctum of Stars:\
1. [Sc] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10683 [70] Tablets of Baa'ri\
2. [Sc] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10684 [70] Oronu the Elder\
3. [Sc] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10685 [70] The Ashtongue Corruptors\
4. [Sc] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10686 [70] The Warden's Cage\
\
After that, the chain comes together for Aldor and Scryer.\
\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10622 [70] Proof of Allegiance\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10628 [70] Akama\
7. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10705 [70] Seer Udalo\
\
Seer Udalo is found in the Arcatraz (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3846) just before the last boss.\
\
8. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10706 [70] A Mysterious Portent\
9. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10707 [70] The Ata'mal Terrace\
10. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10708 [70] Akama's Promise\
\
After you finish this chain, you get to pick from some rewards and the chain seems like it ends. It continues however, inside Serpentshrine Cavern (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3607) from an NPC called Seer Olum (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22820) who you can speak with after killing Fathom-Lord Karathress. He starts the next part of the Black Temple Chain by offering the quest:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10944 [70] The Secret Compromised\
For this quest you just return to Akama.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10946 [70] Ruse of the Ashtongue\
In this quest, you must use the costume Akama provides, and kill A'lar in Tempest Keep: The Eye while wearing the Ashtongue Cowl. Attunement for The Eye is a whole different chain.\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10947 [70] An Artifact From the Past\
In this, you need to gain access to The Battle of Mount Hyjal in Caverns of Time, and slay the first boss, Rage Winterchill. Attunement for this involves killing Lady Vashj and Kael'Thas Sunstrider.\
4. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10948 [70] The Hostage Soul\
For this you must speak with A'dal in Shattrath city.\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10949 [70] Entry into the Black Temple\
For this, just speak with the naaru Xi'ri in front of Black Temple.\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10985 [70] A Distraction for Akama\
Unknown what this quest asks of you, most likely you need to defend Xi'ri and make your way into Black Temple. At the end, you become attuned to enter and are granted The Medallion of Karabor (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32649)\
\
At this point, you are attuned and can enter Black Temple, although the chain continues and you can soon upgrade your medallion. It continues with:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10958 [70] Seek Out the Ashtongue\
You just need to find Seer Kanai (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=23158) inside Black Temple.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10957 [70] Redemption of the Ashtongue\
This involves entering Black Temple, and killing the boss the Shade of Akama (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22841).\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10959 [70] The Fall of the Betrayer\
After killing the Shade of Akama and returning to Seer Kanai, he asks one last thing of you. Kill Illidan The Betrayer. After doing so, you are granted the Blessed Medallion of Karabor, an upgraded version of your original medallion, and allows teleportation to the Black Temple.",

Be aware that the tabard rots after 1 hour playtime. I discovered this to my horror after getting 4/5 kills because of flaky kill credit (and dinner).\

If you leave the area or die, you lose the buff and must unequip and reequip the item.\

My best advice is to reequip the item after you make each kill, just to keep the buff fresh. I noticed that I would randomly lose the buff every other kill, even though there was no buff timer.",

    "107764451730445172007/03/01 11:11:16GahlokA couple of things about this quest:\
\
â¢ Completely sucks if you are a druid, and more if you are the only one in the group that has the quest.\
â¢ Don't try shifting out and equipping the tabard so you have the morph while you get the killing blow, because you can't equip while you are in combat.\
â¢ Be careful where you jump, the tank pulled the mob on an edge, I shifted to flight form and totally forgot that I had the morph on, and since we were in combat it was gg.\
\
Maybe a bear (I'm feral) doesn't need the morph, but this is only as long as there are other people that have the same quest line: I tried this with other 2, none had it, and every time we killed them I didn't get any credit. I also asked them to stop hitting the mobs (I went healing mode) so I could get the killing blow, but the tank hit just when he had like 1hp probably ...",
    "107764439330443932007/03/01 06:19:56CeceliaThe buff seems kind of buggy. We had a couple of them last night where we didn't get credit, but the others worked fine. In all seven cases we had a Holy Pally without the disguise healing.\
\
Note that the disguise tabard has a 60 minute duration on it. If the timer is nearly up, abandon the quest and use the flare gun before starting. You can take the quest again and get a new tabard with 60 minutes on it. A half hour is more then enough time to do the quest for a group of 3 or more. (I don't know what would happen if you also didn't have the flare gun anymore.)",

    "1077628063160280632007/01/31 03:02:05DalindraMake sure a pet does not get the killing blow...we learned that the hard way.",
    "1077611229411775472007/06/28 10:16:22BeolinThis is correct, but be aware that it also loses all progress in the quest. So if you kill 4/5 colossi and die and reget the quest, you'll be back at 0/5. This makes this a quite difficult quest without a good group, particularly if opposing faction members are making a nuisance of themselves.\
\
Also note that the \"edges\" of the field are actually part of the next area and if you go too close, your disguise will fade and you have to start over. Good luck!",

You'll have to make some friends for this one.",
    "107763584960358492007/02/14 11:19:57TrollsynFrom my experience, you don't need the killing blow.\
\
I tanked 5 of them shapeshifted as bear, and I didn't do all the killing blows - nontheless I got all the kills. The one thing you DO however need to remember is to unwear/wear the tabard each time you've shapeshifted back to night-elf.",

\
Basically pull 13-15 mobs aoe them down with consecrates, sweeping strikes. No problems whatsoever.\
\
There are a lot of adds usually, and mobs come in packs of 2 warriors (sometimes +1 spell person) , patrolling sons of gurok, and patrolling cavaliers. There's a -75% spell damage spell, but no other notable abilities. The casters make some arcane bursts or something that damage you for ~900 arcane damage.",

\
They are easy to kill, but have a LOT of hit points. If you have a DPS friend bring them along. Remember these giants spawn small rock creature adds which I didnt see mentioned, like the Rock Giants in Hellfire Peninsula",

    "107767754730775472007/05/04 08:01:04futtTo repeat that quest if you failed/lost the tabard, abandon the quest, use the flare gun and retake the quest, the quest giver will give you another Tabard.",
    "107766767651515502007/04/15 12:56:44wiztanThey split at 75%, 50% and 25%. You can avoid a split if you want by stunning them when passing these levels, but then you don't get the benefit of getting a weaker giant to kill, so it's nothing I recomend doing.\
\
The fight is very straight forward with pure melee dmg. Hits fairly hard but nothing extreme. No problem to duo as tegwyn said with tank/healer, DPS helps to speed up fight but not really needed.\
\
The rule about killing blow seems correct also, I did most of the damage in one fight but didn't have the disguise on me so my partner, that did have the disguise, finished him off and we got a successfull kill.",

Every time you drop a scanner there's a chance a Wyrm from Beyond (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21796) will spawn. Not too hard to solo, but keep an eye out.\
\
You have to work fairly quickly, the scanners are on a short timeout. The scanners have some restrictions on where they can be placed, but it's not simply distance; I've put two within five yeards of each other Look to your buffs for plus-sign shaped buffs showing you the scanners in range, and a minus-sign shaped debuff if you can't drop a scanner where you're staying.",

A list by Greengoo\
\
1. Kindness\
- Kill 8 Rocknail Flayers, Use Carcasses to Feed 8 Dragons (don't move!). Also make sure to travel a bit when laying the meat, as the same drakes won't eat twice in a row.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10804\
\
2. Seek Out Neltharaku\
- Fly on your mount and find Neltharaku, he patrols slowly around Dragonmaw about a few hundred feet up. You'll have to be about 5 yards UNDER him to talk to him.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10811\
\
3. Neltharaku's Tale\
- Listen to story.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10814\
\
4. Infiltrating Dragonmaw Fortress\
- Kill 15 of any type of orcs in the fortress.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10836\
\
5.To Netherwing Ledge!\
- Find 12 Crystals from the floating island SE of the mainland.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10837\
\
6. The Force of Neltharaku\
- Free 5 Dragons by using the item on them, then killing the orcs they agro.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10854\
\
7. Karynaku\
- Find Karynaku, she's the second story of the fortress.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10858\
\
8. Zuluhed the Whacked\
- Kill Zuluhed and recover the key. I recommend pulling him inside so as to avoid the archers, and kill him BEFORE he summons his add. Use the key he drops to free Karynaku.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10872\
\
9. Ally of the Netherwing\
- Return to Mordenai, you will immediately gain 42,000 rep and become neutral.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10870\
\
10. ????\
- Blizzard has announced that next patch they will be introducing a continuence of this quest line, including the ability to get exalted and purchase or receive through extensive questing an EPIC netherdrake mount. You will need epic training to use it however, so save your gold!",

\
Building a Soul Cannon 500 rep\
Bring the guy at camp 2 felsteel bars, 1 adamantite frame, 1 khorium power core, and one quest item. You get the quest item in terrokar forest in the area above the horde base that you can only get to with a flying mount. There's a guy there who will summon 5 elementals of each element one at a time, after you kill each of them you get the item, all easily soloable.\
\
This leads to :\
\
Subduing the Subduer 500 rep\
You have to channel a spell from your mount onto xxx the subduer a 73 elite in twilight ridge in nagrand. What you have to do is keep far enough back from him, and dodge his bolts to eventually drain his life down, I found it easier to train him around the center of the camp keeping across the center from him at all times (note: height has nothing to do with melee range so don't try to just fly high enough that he won't melee you). Be careful not to die too far in the air. Once you win you get to choose between 4 green quest rewards, none of which are very overwhelming.\
\
Disrupting the Twilight Generator (Daily) 500 rep\
Kill any 20 of the mobs at the same place as the above quest.\
\
Race quests 500 each for first 5, 1000 for 6th\
At this level you also unlock the Race quests. Basically this is a series of 6 quests where you try to fly behind each of the riders and not get knocked off by the bombs/magic/meteors they throw at you. The first 5 aren't too bad once you learn how to avoid their attacks. The final race is either really rough or bugged at the moment, because if you aren't right on top of the guy he'll despawn. The others you could get a little range to dodge at least. Also a riding crop/pally aura makes this a lot easier since he's faster than you, reward is a +10% mount speed trinket.\
\
This opens up at REVERED:\
\
The greatest trap ever (Daily) (3 man group)- 500 rep\
You are told that you need to lead a group of dragonmaw to attack the aldor(scryer) base, once there you talk to a few npc's then start an attack. You will have 8 non elite npc's assisting you and 1 elite npc, your goal is to keep the elite npc alive while fending off all the dragonmaw. There are several waves of these guys so just try to dps them down as best you can. The battle takes place literally 3 steps from the graveyard so it isn't hard to just walk over and rez if you die.\
\
Repeat these until exalted and enjoy your mount :)",

\
I used my hunter to kill the 3 channelers from the roof top (you can move out of LoS to avoid some of the ranged attacks) then quickly logged my warrior and was able to grind deathwail down to 10% before an unlucky fear meant I got adds from inside the building :(",

At first I tried to kill Deathwail from on top of the building, but he ran out of mana from Shadowbolting and evaded back to full health. After a few more tries I found out he can be feared/deathcoiled, so I cleared out the adds in the area and chain feared/nuked him to death.\
Hope this helps, good luck. :)",
    "107079608760960872007/06/02 17:54:30senexlockAlong with the added ranged dps by adds, Deathwail is now immune to fear.  \
\
However this is still extremely easy  for a warlock to solo.  Kill three channelers and wait for packs despawn.  The two close to the building kill from the ledges and the one you cant reach, stand on an invisible column in the corner of the walls, than once they are done wait for ALL packs to despawn than move to Deathwail.  \
\
Keep Shadow ward up, and COT. This is important because obviously you take less damage but also it slows the time it takes for him to run out of mana.  If you don't kill him before he runs out of mana he will either evade (as mentioned above) or melee you, and you would much rather him throwing off extremely slow shadow bolts instead of reseting or meleeing you. \
\
Also if you use your Felhunter make sure you don't silence him, it will act as the same as him running out of mana.",
    "1070731509590315092007/02/06 01:28:35peesHeres a cheese way to do it:\
\
1) Bring a ranged lvl 70 class that can reach 36-41 yards\
2) Fly on top of the building and start plugging away at the soulstealers. They will not evade.\
3) The spawn waves will come out but won't attack you on top of the building.\
4) Shadowlord Deathwail will now land when the soulstealers are all dead, just wait a few minutes for the spawns to disappear then you can fight him all alone.\
\
Note: I tried this solo but i did not attempt to fully fight him. I attacked him from on top of the building and he did not evade since he does a ranged shadowbolt that only hits for ~1k.\
\
It may be possible to ranged tank him from the roof while taking no physical damage if your group lacks a warrior/druid/pally tank. Though his melee only hit for 900ish on cloth",
    "1070751178100511782007/03/14 16:29:02DaAznSaNAs a hunter:\
\
From the roof, kill the three casters around the pole. As stated above, they will not fight back and the melee that spawn will not be able to reach you. When the casters are all dead, wait for Shadowlord Deathwail to land and the rest of the adds to despawn.\
\
Deathwail is susceptible to Freezing Trap, Scatter Shot, and Silencing Shot, all of which are handy abilities for this fight. I also recommend wearing at least two Beast Lord armor pieces for the reduced trap cooldown. Talent points in Clever Traps and Trap Mastery are useful but not necessary (I didn't have them). The fight is pretty independent of gear besides the Beast Lord armor, and even so it'll just require you to take an extra shadow bolt every now and then if you don't have it. You may want to stack a little more HP than normal. Time does not seem to be an issue since I spent about twelve minutes doing the quest, starting from when I fired my first arrow to when Deathwail died; staying alive should be prioritized over doing damage (although doing more damage will reduce the length of the encounter, thus reducing the margin of error).\
\
The general idea is to nuke Deathwail with an Aimed Shot, Multi-Shot, Arcane Shot, and Auto-Shot rotation. When it casts shadowbolt, fire a Silencing Shot to pull it into your Freezing Trap. Run to the other side of the platform and wait for your traps to cooldown. A mod that counts down the duration of your traps is very handy; I recommend Sorren's Timers (found here http://files.wowace.com/). Just as your Freezing Trap is about to expire, charge up another Aimed Shot, etc. combo and pull it into your trap with Silencing Shot. From here, it's repetition.\
\
Some things can and will go wrong. If your trap is resisted, make use of your Scatter Shot to stun him and line of sight (LOS) to avoid his shadow bolts. A good place to exploit LOS is the nook to the right of the building's entrance, as well as the very left corner of the building. This is where the reduced trap cooldown especially comes in handy.\
\
If you trap ends prematurely, do the same thing as if it was resisted.\
\
Because Deathwail will only cast shadow bolts when not silenced, if you fail to pull him far enough to run into your trap with Silencing Shot, use your Scatter Shot and hope that it'll cause him to walk dazedly into your trap. Otherwise, use LOS again.\
\
Be careful when trapping him in melee range. He might land a hit on you before he is affected by the trap, and your character might automatically attack back and break the trap. Make sure you turn your back to him if you plan to trap him within melee range of you. You'll see me do this often.\
\
When he's trapped, that's the perfect time to use bandages.\
\
Here's a video of me doing the fight. I made a lot of mistakes but still managed to complete it easily.\

Just pull the ranged adds around a corner, be sure they stay in melee. Then move to the chanellers and \"dps\" them down, watch out for the fires, be sure you have trinkets/equipment that improves your block rating and value. Also, I found the figurine of the colossus work very well here, it heals a godly amount with all those orcs on you.\
\
Once the elite chanellers are down, move to the right side of the entrance of the nearby building to avoid pulling the \"boss\". Dps the orcs you got left down, eat up/bandage and get ready for the boss. I pulled him around that same corner to avoid getting respawns on me. Now for that fight, do *not* let any kind of shadow bolt hit you, they do rather heavy damage (around 1k). Be sure you always have rage for spell reflect, and only use it to reflect the \"Shadow Bolt\". He also does a \"Shadow Bolt Volley\", which you need to shield bash, or concussive blow. Rince and repeat, and he will be down after about 5 minutes.\
\
That's about it, remember to use your cooldowns, trinkets, potions etc, and you won't need a group for this quest.\

Just make sure you make use of LOS. 2 elites are easily killed from the roof. The spawns are killable, but you can also wait for despawn. If you choose to kill them, lifebloom > their damage. Just nuke the hell of of them.\
\
Once you got the 2 elites, fly to the other side and kill the last one from the other ledge. You should be able to get out of combat after killing him so you can fly to the roof again while the boss lands. If there are still spawns, wait for them to despawn or kill them like mentioned above. Deathwail is fairly easy. Like mentioned above his shadowbolts only do 1k dmg every now and then. Nothing a rolling lifebloom can't fix.

    "11090202563211945632007/12/16 22:14:43BrainsnackAnother confirmation about above tactics, BUT there is something i would like to add for the more lazy people, like myself; You can stay on the portal, but you have to be out of his line of sight to avoid being hit by anything!\
\
[Story]\
\
First try:   I read above comments, so I thought it would be a peace of cake. I flew a little between the portal and the big red dude, started the channeling and moved onto the portal. But Reth was still hitting me with every ranged trick he had and I got hit by a meteor, bounced off the portal and got vanquished by an elite pat and his buddy's.\
\
Second try:   I began to think, that the trick must have been fixed. So I tried the same thing, just began somewhere else. This time, I started hovering above the edge of the portal (you can't be landed or else the channeling will not begin), just enough to get in range, and started the channeling. I tried to avoid his attacks by strafing left and right, but his Shadow Bolts we're hitting me for 600-1000 dmg (on mail) and I would not make it to the end of the channeling, which will take a bit of time. Eventually an exploding meteor got me.\
\
Third try:   Because the above comments were really recent, I figured there had to be something I wasn't thinking of. So I decided to give it another try. I started to hover above the edge of the portal again, started channeling and just eased back on to the portal. I landed and moved just slightly back some more, so I was out of his line of sight. And heck, this time everything played out as I had hoped! Reth was just standing there, trying his Cripples and Shadow Bolts, but nothing would hit me. When you need to start a new channeling session, just move forward a bit, up if you have to, and repeat.\
\
As always, the great hints here helped me clear another quest on my path to Netherwing history.",

I did it as a mage. Suggestions: mage armor, dampen magic, mana shield before to go on your flying mount. Start draining, just fly around him avoiding everything. If you have it, bring some stamina or pvp gear. I lost 5k hp doing this quest, not that much, but better to be sure.\

Here's the trick\
The pillar (obelisk) stones with 4 mobs channeling some spell around them, kite him to one of them. In order for him to get to you, he has to go around the stones. So what i did was just kite him (in circles) around those stones. It keeps him out of melee range, and when i was crippled it bought me enough time to move out the way. \

Hopefully that helps.",

The soul cannon has a range of 60 yards, which should be plenty. The key is to be 60 yards away from him, not 60 yards directly above him. If you are directly above him he will melee you and you will die.\
\
-Activate cannon, dodge his fireballs with your flying mount.\
\
- At no point should you ever get into his melee range, or he will hit you for ~3-6k. If this happens even once you are probably dead. Possibly in mid-air, and requiring a spirit rez. Stay in range of the soul cannon, out of his melee range. Basically just fly around while he follows you. Don't go too far though, or you will lose combat and he will reset. Don't worry about the shadowbolts, they won't kill you unless you get melee'd first.\
\
- Multiple people can get credit for subduing him even if they aren't grouped. I started using my soul cannon on him when someone else already had him down to 50%, and I still got credit for it. I was not grouped with the other person. \

After 2-3 cripple attacks I was down to like 10-15% hp and had to fly away to eat.

The tactic I used is basicly staying in range, above him, flying around him clockwise while draining his soul. This way you will only take the shadow bolt damage (800ish). If you get cripple on you start going anti clockwise, so you dont run into the fireballs. The fireballs really hurt also dismounts you, and you die. Will take you a while till you suck his soul out, once hes on 1% hes starting to walk to the portal and leaves the place.\
If you seem to take too much damage during an attempt you can flee away by just flying far from him.\

I was able to 2-man it with myself (prot warrior) and a MM/SV spec hunter, but it was rough.\

I had, at the time, around 12k armor and 11k HPs with 500+ defense (your basic \"ready to start Kara but not much beyond that\" gear) and I still had to blow both Last Stand and a potion.  Keeping him tclapped and demo shouted and spamming shield block+revenge was key, as you said, but he still got me well below the 75% HPs you say he got you too.\
\
Maybe if your tank class is epic'd out it becomes as easy as you say... but for the average tank in 5-man drops and such (who is likely to be the tank doing this quest for the axe, not many raiders would give a crap about it other than for some gold at 70) it isn't a cakewalk.

\
It may even be possible to solo Ruul this way as a warlock, but the biggest issue is threat. The overseer generates little threat (~250 tps), so it is difficult to dps and health funnel without pulling aggro. However, with sufficient aggro reduction (e.g., soulshatter, threat-reduction items) it might be possible.\

After Ruul is slain, his Netherdrake is fearable, so you can opt to either re-enslave or banish your demon.",

\
Fly high out of bombing range and align yourself to where you want to bomb, but much too high. Right click your explosive and aim the eggs you want to bomb. When the birds fly under you and out of aggro range, use the X key to lower yourself into bombing range - when your targetting reticle turns green, bomb the eggs quick and hit the spacebar the instant you're done casting to get out of aggro altitude right away. Rinse and repeat.",

It is a bit like the bombing run quests in Hellfire Peninsula (The two Gateways Murketh and Shaadraz, as well as the Abyssal Shelf) except that you do it from your own flying mount and can control where you go, rather then on a pre-determined path.\
\
The main thing to this is avoiding the Monstrous Kaliri that fly around the city. If they aggro onto you, they do damage and have a chance of dismounting you if they hit from behind-most likely sending you on a fall to your death. They also have hamstring (Wouldnât Wing Clip make more sense seeing as weâre flying?). There are some very good tips to avoiding these guys above.",

\
1. Stand in the middle of the X and move your camera view so that it's literally looking straight down. Zoom in so that it takes up much of the screen.\
2. Align the cross so that each colour is aligned top, bottom, left and right.\
3. Type /s as if you're going to say something then press num lock so you're ready to type numbers on the keypad\
\
What you're going to do here is use the number key pad on your keyboard as if it represents the cross.\
\
Look now at your keyboard and you'll see four arrows on numbers.\
8 is UP\
4 is LEFT\
6 is RIGHT\
2 is DOWN\
\
4. Insert your crystal and type out the colours on the number keypad as they occur. You might not need it for the first few, but when it gets harder you don't even need to concentrate.\
5. Watch and type on pad at the same time, pressing enter at the end of each sequence\
6. Press the colours with mouse as they were typed out:\
\
Example:\
Typing away, if I had typed: 84662486\
Then I could press the colours TOP, LEFT, RIGHT, RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT, TOP, RIGHT.\

\
Stealth towards the first set of guards who can see through stealth and /wave to them because you're not going that way. Continue down into the water in front of you and below Rokmar the Crackler. If you swim up towards the ledge he is on, you'll notice the walls have overhangs so you can't wall walk up them. Well, along the left and right sides there is another wall connected to the overhang that is about 98% vertical. That 2% is what makes this possible.\
\
Wall jump up the nearly vertical wall and onto the ledge above. I'm not saying it's easy, in fact it's fairly difficult due to the steepness of the slant as well as getting the first jump up since you have to start from swimming. However, it only takes about 8 consecutive jumps and then you're up. From there stealth backwards through the instance and there are no guards who can see through stealth between you and him.\

\
avoid the first boss on the ramp, and the patrols above him on the way to the second patrol with 2 mobs that can see through stealth. wait until the regular patrols on the bridge are heading away, and repeat the above. jump off the bridge into the pool and wait for the mobs to evade. when you come out of the pool Skar'this the Heretic is all the way on the left side, in a cage. \

\
I soulstoned myself before going into the instance, and ninjaed past the crab dudes.  Just run on one side when they're on the other.  I drank an invis pot to make it through the hallway.  You can then ninja past the patrol in the open room by going to the right and then to the left.  Hide behind the lightpost at the far left side of the island in the middle of the room until both three-packs are clear, and then run across and behind to the two Defenders.  I set my imp on them and drank a swiftness potion.  This is tricky, but you should be able to get far enough down the hallways to not aggro when you pop your SS.\
\
Wait til your SS is back up and SS yourself again.  Use the next invis pot to run up the first ramp.  Summon your voidwalker.  Then wait until your swiftness pot cooldown is up.  When the three pack patrol walks by run the opposite way up the next ramp.  When you see the two pack patrol, set your voidwalker on them, and drink a swiftness potion.  When he's about to die, or you're about to run into the next defender pack (whichever comes first), sac your voidwalker for the shield.  This should put you in a position to pop SS out of aggro from the defenders when they pat back to the ramp you were just on.  Wait until your next invis pot is up and pop SS.  Immediately drink your invis pot and run around the next ramp and jump off into the water.  Jump onto the ledge to the left and ninja past the next three-pack, and the NPC is right there.\
\
I also had the 12 spell dmg + minor run speed meta gem while doing this, that may have helped a bit.\

Enjoy wiping in SSC! :D",

The phrase \"Gort! Klaatu barada nikto!\" was used to stop Gort, the robot in the film, from destroying the world.\

There is no known translation for the phrase, although \"Klaatu\" is the name of the humanoid alien protagonist in the film, while nikto means nobody in Russian.\

In World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade, two NPCs exist together named Klaatu and Barada. One named Nikto hasn't been sighted yet.\

1. Kindness\
- Kill 8 Rocknail Flayers, Use Carcasses to Feed 8 Dragons (don't move!). Also make sure to travel a bit when laying the meat, as the same drakes won't eat twice in a row.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10804\
\
2. Seek Out Neltharaku\
- Fly on your mount and find Neltharaku, he patrols slowly around Dragonmaw about a few hundred feet up. You'll have to be about 5 yards UNDER him to talk to him.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10811\
\
3. Neltharaku's Tale\
- Listen to story.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10814\

- Find Karynaku, she's the second story of the fortress.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10858\
\
8. Zuluhed the Whacked\

http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10872\
\
9. Ally of the Netherwing\
- Return to Mordenai, you will immediately gain 42,000 rep and become neutral.\

Soloed this quest with moderate difficulty. My gear was pretty decent at the time, with mostly Str/Stamina/S.Dmg variant gear from instances/quests --  and the rest Warrior type gear. I was fully enchanted with stamina save for head and shoulder pieces.\
\
The fight started off really great -- Basically a mainstay of Crusader Judgement and Seal of Righteousness. I would keep Holy Shield up 100% of the time, and HoJ when my HP reached about half. During the HoJ is a great time to activate the Ancient Crystal Talisman trinket and refresh Righteousness. This is when I started using Consecrate -- and subsequently he started blasting me into the distance. 1 Bubble, a Bandage, Arcane Torrent (for mana), and a Regal Protectorate activation later -- I was able to take him down -- 3 seconds before I would have hit Lay on Hands =D\

\
Started with pyroblast (combustion and trinket helps), fireball and a fireblast (if he's stunned you can get more stuff in, just be careful: he hits hard).\
Then blinked and ran towards the bridge east of his location. As soon as fireblast was up (while running) I jumped and used it backwards at him midair, to keep him from resetting. Then I ran in 8:s over and off the bridge, spamming those fireblasts as soon as they were up. If not: he'll reset (did countless of times for me until I managed to kill him). \
\
Make sure you wait till he's up on the bridge before jumping down, and don't run up until he's heading down towards you.\
Might take some practice to get it to work, but at least you won't die trying (he resets if you fail)...unless he gets to you and hits too many times.\

Extra tip: you can get him to move back and forth on the bridge if you do the same when down in the water. Happened to me for a while and I got in 2 fireblasts before he decided to run down via one of the sides.",

All I did was strafe in the other direction when he started launching his lightning bolts and tried to stay below his left wing. Once you get the gist of his flight path this ones not *as* annoying.\

\
k all u have to do is stay above him really far up but not to far then make sure ur straightend out and use left click to look down stay at that camera angel and steer left and right and go up when u need to just watch out where he is or u might go to high\
there is one trouble point near the end where he takes a drop down near that dock looking thing with the 2 elite guards so folow him down with right mouse click camera angle then straighten out and go birds eye view again. \
long as u stay directly above him no probs with the bolts.\

\
What worked for me was: stay in front of him as he flies around to the mine at the start.  Use the time he wastes there to get above him and then track him from above using the arrow keys, using X and Space to go up and down as required.\

As mentioned above the only tricky bit was the dive over the cliff and then up the hill beside it.  Get that bit right and you are home free.",

As long as you are not chasing him he's not going to dismount you. If you stay by his side and know his turns, you can just short cut him whenever he does. If you for fall behind and have to chase him, you are most likely screwed unless he is going to turn soon.",

\
- [b]AddOn ImprovedCamera[/b]: Increases limit of the Max Camera Distance slider in Interface Options to the very maximum possible (from 30 to 50).\
\
http://wow.curse.com/downloads/details/5098/\
\
- [b]Youtube videos[/b]: Learning his path makes things much easier, watch it over and over: \
\
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX0yysWOtMc\
\
- [b]Turn off your UI:[/b] Press alt+Z to turn off your interface, so everything on the screen disappears and you can see Mulverick easier.\
\
- [b]Raid Mark him[/b]: Invite some guildmate or random guy to a party, so you can add a mark icon to his head. Personally I used the blue square.\
\
- [b]Buy a Riding Crop:[/b] If you're farming for your netherdrake, you surely have 60-100g to spend on a riding crop. It sucks that after you win this chain of quests you get a riding crop as a reward, but to beat mulverick and captain skyshatter you MUST have this, otherwise it gets close to impossible.\
\
With the tips above, you can easily solo this guy. If you have friends, call them to be hit by his bolts instead of you, and a pally to give you crusader aura.\
\
Hope you all can do it faster than I did, good luck!",
    "11070197209101972092007/12/07 01:22:35PremierBlahI have to agree - the best course of action is stay as much above him as is physically possible and still be counted as in the running, as well as dodging all his Sidewinder Lightning missiles. My suggestion is to try it a few times even if you don't succeed at first, that way you get a good handle of the route you take, which can also help ease the confusion that comes when he sometimes changes course to distract you. Even if I took a few tries it was always frustrating in a fun way.\

    "11070162873201628732007/10/04 13:50:26UmokThis guy is far the hardest of the 6 racers. If you can beat this guy, you can easily beat Skyshatter. Just fly high and avoid as many missles as possible. Another good tip is that if you get lost for like 1-2 seconds, follow his missle trail. I lost him the first time, but quickly recovered and almost nailed it on the first time. After another 3 attempts, I knew the route by heart. I completed after my 5th attempt. Also, he also dive around the transporting dock on netherwing ledge. Just make sure then that you stick close, but for the rest of the run you can fly high.\
\
Don't give up on any of these races. The best way to do is to study their trails. It's much easier if you already know where you going.",

But nothing is more fun than getting knocked off your mount behind a crystal formation not being able to move or mount up, and end up HS'ing back to Shattrah just to fly back and try again.",

\
1)Turn your UI off\
2)Get some race music playing\
3)(the actual strat) Start the race off below and too the left of him, then, when he fires his volley of lightning bolts, move to the right and then up to dodge, and then you should be above and to the right of him, then on the next bolt, move to the left and then down, so you are back around the area where you started, and keep repeating this. If you get too far from him, just try and shortcut your way closer to him, not that hard. he does do this thing where he'l flip around, and then back to the way he was going, just stop going forward and keep an eye on where he goes, then go back to chasing him when he starts back on his normal way.\

    "1107090820121894392007/05/26 06:55:50BeskaI've must have spent a combined total of at least 4 hours trying to find a reliable way of beating him, and this is the best tactic I had come up with, and when using it I won the encounter in only two attempts.\
\
Basically, the lightning bolts track you and that's what makes Mulverick difficult. To trivialize it, invite 3-4 friends into your group and get them to follow him too, dodging the lightning bolts. What happens is that the lightning bolts now track between 5 people (including yourself) rather than just all chasing you. It makes it incredibly easy, and requires you just to keep up with him and dodge a bolt every now and again.\
\
I've found that druids are very good at sucking up the bolts, as when he dismounts them, they can mount right back up in the air and carry on following. If worst comes to worst and they get knocked down, they're the quickest of all classes to remount and get back up to helping you.\
\
If any of your party are knocked down, tell them to remount as soon as possible and join you following him again. Marking Mulverick, yourself and everybody in the party also makes it easier to track where you are.",

- Fly high. His lightning bombs have a finite range - flying above will avoid 99% of the grief.\
\
- Watch for the sudden turns. It is easy to loose sight of the target.\
\
- The one place you can not fly high is at the transport dock. Fly parallel, just off to one side.\
\
- His first approach to the finish line is not the finish. You will have to circle the airfield, during which time you're probabaly aggroing.\

\
The Black Temple attunement starts at The Altar of the Sha'tar for Aldors, and the Sanctum of the Sun for Scryers. Both are in Shadowmoon Valley.\
\
Aldors start attunement from Anchorite Ceyla (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21402) at the Altar of Sha'tar in Shadowmoon Valley:\

4. [Sc] http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10686 [70] The Warden's Cage\
\
After that, the chain comes together for Aldor and Scryer.\
\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10622 [70] Proof of Allegiance\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10628 [70] Akama\
7. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10705 [70] Seer Udalo\
\
Seer Udalo is found in the Arcatraz (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3846) just before the last boss.\
\
8. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10706 [70] A Mysterious Portent\
9. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10707 [70] The Ata'mal Terrace\
10. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10708 [70] Akama's Promise\
\
After you finish this chain, you get to pick from some rewards and the chain seems like it ends. It continues however, inside Serpentshrine Cavern (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=3607) from an NPC called Seer Olum (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22820) who you can speak with after killing Fathom-Lord Karathress. He starts the next part of the Black Temple Chain by offering the quest:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10944 [70] The Secret Compromised\
For this quest you just return to Akama.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10946 [70] Ruse of the Ashtongue\
In this quest, you must use the costume Akama provides, and kill A'lar in Tempest Keep: The Eye while wearing the Ashtongue Cowl. Attunement for The Eye is a whole different chain.\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10947 [70] An Artifact From the Past\
In this, you need to gain access to The Battle of Mount Hyjal in Caverns of Time, and slay the first boss, Rage Winterchill. Attunement for this involves killing Lady Vashj and Kael'Thas Sunstrider.\
4. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10948 [70] The Hostage Soul\
For this you must speak with A'dal in Shattrath city.\
5. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10949 [70] Entry into the Black Temple\
For this, just speak with the naaru Xi'ri in front of Black Temple.\
6. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10985 [70] A Distraction for Akama\
Unknown what this quest asks of you, most likely you need to defend Xi'ri and make your way into Black Temple. At the end, you become attuned to enter and are granted The Medallion of Karabor (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32649)\
\
At this point, you are attuned and can enter Black Temple, although the chain continues and you can soon upgrade your medallion. It continues with:\
\
1. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10958 [70] Seek Out the Ashtongue\
You just need to find Seer Kanai (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=23158) inside Black Temple.\
2. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10957 [70] Redemption of the Ashtongue\
This involves entering Black Temple, and killing the boss the Shade of Akama (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22841).\
3. http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10959 [70] The Fall of the Betrayer\
After killing the Shade of Akama and returning to Seer Kanai, he asks one last thing of you. Kill Illidan The Betrayer. After doing so, you are granted the Blessed Medallion of Karabor, an upgraded version of your original medallion, and allows teleportation to the Black Temple.",

\
For example, my healer is an alchemist, but not very well specced or geared for farming the naga. My warlock, on the other hand, can kill sporebats for hours without needing a break. So I use the 'lock to farm up the fertile spores, and send them to the healer, to turn in for rep.\

\
There is no huge difference in rep / hour. The giants are fast and easy to kill, and there is lots of them at Fungal Vale which raises their farming value compared to mobs that drops Fertile Spores.

MATH:\
Honored rep (12k) + Revered rep (21k) = 33k Rep Points\
Drop Rate on Ogres (33%), 10 rep per ogre, 500 rep per Turn-in.\
So, about 30 kills per turn-in, that's 300 rep (kills) + 500 rep (turn-in) = 800 rep for 30 kills, so...\

33,000 divided by 800 rep = 41.25\

\
13,48 is the exact co-ordinates. As you approach this location from the east, you will see the moonstone on an alter.\
\
You interact with the stone as if to take it, at the end of the channel the goblin will spawn and sap you (As museyes said above, have your pvp trinket equipped to instantly break this).\
\
They jump instantly in the water (having ninja'd the stone off you) and start swimming south down the river. There are mines that will Frost nova you (shift in and out to continue) and other shoot you upwards (knocking you out of aquatic form). \
\
Personally I got to 7,94 before catching up with her. More and more speed boosts become available further down the path, I got 3 or 4 in total.\
\
As Duxa says, for the first part of the trek, hug the right hand side of the river, you'll avoid most of them.\
\
To 'win' simply catch up (and overtake her) at which point she will give in and stop, asking you not to hurt her.\

Simply speak to her to say 'hand it over' and she'll drop the moonstone in your bag!",

I flew in and landed on the corner of the structure at 68, 40 right behind a Darkreaver which did not aggro.

\
1)  Land on the wall at 71,41.  No mob will aggro or pursue you whiel you are standing on this wall, so it is your safe spot.  In front of you will be a row of slayers, which are all single pulls.  \
\
Wait for the elite and the eye of kilrogg to pass heading west (to your left), then get down off the wall pull and kill 1-3 slayers before hopping back up on the wall to wait for the elite pat again.    Note:  You need to fly to get back up on the wall, so give yourself time to mount.  Once you get your 8 slayers move to...\
\
2)  Fly to 72,38 land on the Darkweaver and kill him.  you are safe here from all except a Chosen pat on a long walk (kill him if he comes by), but all of the nearby mobs are bugged so you wil want ot move.  Fly to 71,39 and repeat on this darkweaver.\
\
3)  Fly to 70,35 and land on the wall.  This wall is different from the wall in step 1 in that mobs CAN and WILL path up onto it.  So time your kills to avoid the elite pat, and be in the air when he is coming around.  He's on a fairly long path, maybe 2 minutes.  Stay here and kill Chosen until you are done.  \
\
Note:  To compensite for a slow spawn timer, you can alternate between steps 2 and 3 as the spawns appear.\

Note:  Take the time to learn how the elite path to your kill spot.  it will prevent long lonely trips from the gy.",

    "1658176624101766242007/10/30 00:15:58AnsawaEasily done at level 55. I mounted up, ran all the way up through Silverpine Forest, then just stayed on the road until I could see the statue in the distance. Veered off the road to the right, toward the plateau the ruins are on, passed behind a tree, and moseyed my way on up behind the Wickerman where the guards obviously couldn't see me. Sidled down to stand right behind the effigy, got the quest notification, then took right back off down the road--the guards aggroed on me but never even caught up to hit me once.\
\
Very, very easy way to net 12650 XP, and I daresay anyone over level 40 and mounted could do it that way with no fuss at all. Good luck to everyone doing it at 25; you're braver than I. ;)\
\
Edit: Also, there's no reason for people heading to the Wickerman NOT to go through Silverpine (on the road). The majority of mobs on/near the road up near the top of Hillshore are Alliance-friendly (Dalaran mages), and past that there's nothing over 15-16 near the road. There's ONE Horde NPC, level 13, actually walking on the road itself, but even if you're only level 25, you can easily avoid tangling with him. (Or kill him; he's not even PvP so if you shy from getting yourself flagged, like I do, there's not even that stopping you.)",

\
Otherwise, (see my comment below), there's no reason whatsoever to avoid the road if you're too low-level to travel past Dalaran safely (level 31+ beast mobs). It *may* be a straighter shot, as the crow flies, than going up through Silverpine, but since you're going to be spending a large part of it swimming, I don't know if it will take less time.",

\
The mobs in Dalaran are level 31 or so, and the mobs in this lake are level 18 or thereabouts, which should give you no trouble.  They're murlocs and treants staying on the islands, mostly; keeping to the water should not bring any mobs to bother you.  \
\
Once in the lake, head north and you will reach Undercity very quickly.  Of course, don't go directly up/ into the city.  Just follow the path towards Undercity, and you will see a gigantic burning scarecrow statue thing (56, 69) with 2 giant elite abominations on either side of it.\
\
Here are maps that I've dotted to show the path to take:\

\
\
You will not be able to stealth successfully past them if you are 40 or lower.  Your best bet is to zip up to the statue and die on top of it, so that you will at least have completed the quest. \
\
My level 41 druid tried to stealth up to it though, by creeping along the wall, and was nearly at the statue when one of the abominations noticed.  I basically ran right on top of the statue and managed to get the quest completed as I died. \

Search for \"Fertile Spores\" on this site and read the comments there for great information about where to farm them. I would argue that Fertile Spores will get you reputation up to 30% faster than killing the Bloodscale Naga. \

\
When you walk in, take the right hallway. You will need to stealth very close to some high level mobs, so, you can:\
(a) have Master of Deception\
(b) use a Sneaking Potion (this is what I did, I'm combat spec)\
(c) sprint like a madman and then vanish.\
\
Get to the ramp that Gatewatcher Iron-Hand patrols on. He walks up to the top of the ramp, walks down and says hi to Capacitus, and then walks back up. If you stand on the edge of the ramp he will not see you.\
\
Looking over the edge of the ramp you can see your prize-- there should be 4 Overcharged Manacells there. Closest to you there is a group of 2 Sunfury Engineers, and 2 Mechanar Tinkerers. Don't even think about fighting any of them, you'd die-- we have something much more roguish planned.\
\
Wait until Iron-Hand is at the bottom of the ramp, and then throw/shoot at one of the engineers. They will start to path all the way around the pillar and up the ramp towards you. When they are about to get to you, jump off the ramp landing right next to one of the manacells. Vanish, and grab it. You should have enough time to get it with a couple seconds to spare, before they kindly come back and kill you, porting you out of the instance.\
\
This would have been easy to get in a group, since you only have to clear to the first boss, but if you're up for an exciting challenge, you can try this method.\
\
Enjoy the rest of this excessively long quest chain. ^_^",

\
1. Go invisible and run through the corridor on the right, sticking to the left as you head up through the first hall. There will be a barrier on the left. Head to it and let Invisibility wear off there.\
\
2. Gatewatcher Ironhand's patrol path takes approximately 55 seconds. Once the cooldown has finished for Invisibility, wait for him to come up to the top of the ramp, behind the mo'arg and blood elfs. When he turns to head back down, cast Invisibility, wait for the fade, and then head to the ramp.\
\
3. Once you're on the ramp, climb up onto the left side of it and cast Mana Shield to dispel invisibility. There is a guard at the top of the ramp and a group of mobs at the bottom of the ramp, so you will need to space yourself midway between the two ends of the ramp as you stand on the ledge.\
\
You will see the mana cells down below you, a short drop away.\
\
4. As soon as you can target them, fireblast any of the four mobs (two non-elites, two elites). They will start pathing around the column, aggroing two other groups on the way. Wait until they almost on top of you or about to hit you with ranged attacks, then jump down next to a mana cell.\
\
5. This apparently breaks line of sight. Immediately loot the nearest mana cell and prepare to die. You did disrobe prior to this exercise, correct?",

    "97263460650346062007/02/12 10:14:41KathuckaThis quest is much easier while in a group, as you'll be prone to getting multiple naga attacking you.  Also, as the goal here is simply to kill a certain number of naga, it goes much more quickly in a group.\
\
Watch out for the water elemental sentries.  If left alone too long after spotting you, they'll call for help over a wide area.  You can get six naga attacking you at the same time if that happens.  Fortunately, the sentries have low health, so they can be killed quickly.\
\
The female naga (Enchantresses) are much less common than the male ones.  Seek them out first.  They channel arcane missiles, which can be interrupted.  Watch out for their \"Circle of Ice\" spell.  It gradually forms a ring of ice blocks on the ground around you.  If you're in the middle of the ring when it completes, it hits for huge damage and roots you in place.  Just move out of the way when you see the ice blocks.\
\
The male naga (Slavedrivers) will call nearby slaves for help.  If you kill the naga, the slave will evade and run back to its spawn point.",

Search for \"Fertile Spores\" on this site and read the comments there for great information about where to farm them. I would argue that Fertile Spores will get you reputation up to 30% faster than killing the Bloodscale Naga. \

4. (S) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10686][70] The Warden's Cage[/url]\
\
At this point the chains converge for both factions:\
5. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10622][70] Proof of Allegiance[/url]\
6. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10628][70] Akama[/url]\
7. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10705][70] Seer Udalo (Dungeon)[/url]\
\
Here, you have to venture into the [b]Arcatraz[/b] (which requires a Rogue with 350 lockpicking or somebody to open the door who's completed the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10262]Arcatraz Key chain[/url], which requires trips to the Mechanar and the Botanica respectively) to the room just before the final boss.  Sadly it's (nearly) impossible to stealth to.  Finding Udalo leads to:\
\
Talk to Akama:\
8. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10706][70] A Mysterious Portent[/url]\
Kill waves of nonelites, 3 elites and a boss (5-man) on a terrace outside the Black Temple:\
9. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10707][70] The Ata'mal Terrace[/url]\
Finally, deliver the medallion to A'dal in Shattrath City:\
10. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10708][70] Akama's Promise[/url]\
\
Then, at last, you can choose between the following rewards: \

Quest is very easy for Feral druid (moonglade set in my case). Just interrupt his casting with maim and youll be fine. Imp Leader of The Pack should be enought to heal you. If not just throw a HOT after maim.\
\
I didnt even have to use cyclone.\
\
DPS here is vital, kill him asap or debuff he casts on you becoms deadly.\
If you are resto i would recomend bringing a friend tho.\
But if you have good reflexes you still should be able to kill him. Just use maim to interrupt and HOTs if needed. It will take more time, but i think its still possible.\

There is also problem with GY. If you die during this quest you wont be able to get to your body. So spirit healer is only choice, not very cool as we all know.",

\
* Sunwell Isle is a new zone, north of Silvermoon City\
\
* The 5-man wing of the instances is called Magister's Terrace featuring normal and heroic difficulty\
\
* The raid wing is called Sunwell Plateau, players can fight 6 raidbosses here and the one of the main stories of Burning Crusade continues here\
\
* Outside the instances there will be lots of quests (daily quests too), wrapping up the story of Tempest Keep\
\
* The questhub of the zone will be interactive, as players complete quests, the activity in the town will increase more and more, eventually growing into a big town, similar to how Silithus prepared for the Qiraji war, on a smaller scale though\
\
* The quests and instances introduce a new faction called \"Shattered Sun Offensive\", the Aldors and Scryers unite under this name to stop Kael'thas from summoning Kil'Jaeden (upd)\
\
* One of the bosses in the Magister's Terrace will be Kael'thas, whose story continues the Verdant Sphere quest. He'll have a large green crystal attached to his chest ^^\
\
* Kil'jaeden will be featured in the 25-man instance, and the EPICness of the fight will be on par with Illidan's. There are 5 more bosses: Brutalicus, a pit lord; Kalecgos, the blue dragon from the Sunwell Trilogy (who is enslaved by Kil'jaeden); a Fel Dragon; female Eredar twins; and a Dark Naaru!\
\
* The raidinstance is designed for players with Tier 6 equipment and it will be slightly more difficulty than Black Temple (upd)\
\
* There won't be a Tier 7 raidset, however there are sets in the loottables (upd)\
\
* The raidinstance doesn't have an attunement requirement, but players of the entire realm must complete a certain amount of daily quests on the Sunwell Isle, to unlock the last 3 bosses (upd)",

http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22520\
or the Verdant Sphere we're curenly discussing.\
\
So for example the Eye of C'thun confirms C'thun's demise, while The Phylactery of Kel'Thuzad  or the Verdant Sphere confirm Kel and Kael aren't dead. \

From within the sphere, Kael calls to a higher power, that higher power being Kil'jaeden.

    "110071378981811368882007/08/14 15:19:45CheffsActually, Kael is indeed allied with the burning legion. He realized that Illidan was insane, so he turned his back on him. Thats the reason horde players can kill blood elfs and, eventuelly Kael himself. The scryers didn't like that he allied with The burning legion, so they left and are now fighting him instead. The blood elfs still in azeroth doesn't know about that Kael'thas is evil,so they continue to travel to outland. \
\
This it what he yells when you turn in the quest.\

Silence descends upon Shattrath \
A'dal's thoughts invade your mind \

Kael'thas Sunstrider yells: And there is nothing you or that fool, Illidan, can do to stop me! You have both served me in your own right - unwittingly. \

    "11007187747111576142007/11/19 15:16:44KamisutraIn the Games for Windows september issue(I highly encourage anyone interested in the instance to get a copy of it), I mentioned before, Metzen said that one of the reasons for implementing the Sunwell was that he wanted the Burning Crusade expansion pack to have a clear ending and the players to achieve a clear victory over the Burning Legion. \
\
So while Kil'jaeden might indeed not die, I'm fairly sure he'll at least end up without a body like Sargeras did. As the fact that  the Burning Legion constantly tries to conquer Azeroth and constantly fails despite all its power has become rather old, very fast. Blizzard does have more psychologically interesting and more viewer appealing villains anyways, Arthas, Azshara, Deathwing.\
\
On a side note, if Blizzard decided to kill him off anyway, getting killed by 25 super powered mortals, while in a weakened half-summoned state, sounds as a prettier way to go than being blown up by a bunch of whisps. :P",

\
Alliance will be able to get to the instance without having to ride through Ghostlands and Eversong(though Blizzard hasn't yet specified how, I assume a teleport or a boat).\
\
Arthas will have no direct involvement in the reappearence of the Sunwell, the Sunwell will be reignited thanks to the energy transfered from Outland's Netherstorm via Kael'thas(it turns out that's what the Manaforges were build for).\

You pull them by concussion shooting the blood elf. She will be behind from this point. Then you concentrate your fire on the giant and pull him down the hill on the east side (you lose about 7000 HP from falling down), through the netherwing pass past the air elementals, and up through netherwing fields and then out on the road. \
\
The giant is simple, just normal kiting (except that the terrain makes it difficult), but the blood elf is very hard. If your pet is full arcane resistance spec you should be able to kill her after you kite the giant down. Kiting the BE was difficult because she has a 30 yard range on her arcane missiles, while my gun has a 35 yard range, so you gotta stay out of her range, while still getting off a shot at her now and then. I think it's easiest to let the pet tank her once the giant is down. \

Also, when you kill the giant, you can then FD and return to her spawn point and kill only her.\

\
Send in pet at the elf, use every cooldown and trinket that you have, keep Mend Pet up, and try to kill him before both pet and you die. It's very close and you need a bit of luck, but it's do-able. You have to tank the giant for at least half the fight because the HoT from Mend Pet will make him come for you after a few ticks. This is good though, the pet won't live long enough against both of them. Pop a healing pot, whatever, just try to get the elf down. If you can do that then you can feign death and have plenty of time to revive pet and recover hp/mp before taking on the giant, who isn't much of a problem by himself.\

Would be much, much easier duo though, neither mob is all that hard one-on-one. If both of them weren't immune to freeze traps this would be a piece of cake.",

DPS the elf making sure to keep enough threat on the tank to prevent your squishy priest friend from getting smashed flat.  Utilize anything you can to interrupt the arcance missiles...they hurt.\

when you click on the egg, a nether whelp will spawn -- knock the whelp down to 1/2 or less health before using the modulator on him, makes the final dragon much easier to kill (they inherit the amount of health).

They are similar to the other potions you can buy with shards, they only work in blade's edge and Gruul's Lair.\
\
After that drink NPC came, the waves of monsters became entirely elites and we were overrun (there were 5 of us fighting aside from the NPCs).\
\
I'd imagine the longer you fight, the more checkpoints you reach and different things happen (like more vendors with rare stuff or something).  5 was not enough people to do this (though we weren't all partied).\
\
I'd suggest getting as many people as possible to do it, use general chat to call for help from the whole zone if you can.  The rewards seem to affect everyone who is present.\
\
Hopefully some of you out there will get farther than we did and can share what happens later on.\
\
One last thing to note is that once we were overrun the potion seller disappeared, so it seems you can only buy things during the fight, not after (unless you win, I'd assume).",
    "11119135025901350252007/08/09 16:19:31thepeerAssault on Bash'ir Landing!\
Located at 54,10\
Blades Edge Mountains\
\
The following guide is a compilation of zone, quest, bestiary, loot, and comments from various sources.\
\
No comments offered specific names for elite mobs so some error is very likely.  A Boss loot table is available for the Bash'ir Reckoner which is actually random world drops for this zone.  The final boss is called The Grand Collector who has no loot table.\
\
Survival of the NPC vendors is mandatory for completion of all three Phases. **NPCs cannot be healed.** An easy way is consecrate, and they wonât ever get hit except by the last boss's AoE bolts. Using two forces to 1) defend NPCs and 2) assault the waves of spawns will need to be organized.  \
\
We recently attempted this with a balanced group of 15 (3 tanks; 3 paladins; lots of ranged dps) Kara/Heroic geard players and vent.  We only had one death at the end of the event, but unfortunately the NPC died from the final boss.  During each phase, the mobs will spawn in a 180Â° arc a short distance from the NPC.  If you keep your two teams close to the NPCs, the mobs will come to you in groups of 3 or 4 which helps to avoid body pulls.\
\
Completion of Phase I summons the Aether-tech Assistant Potion Vendor â requires <10 participants\
All flasks cost (10 Apexis) and may be purchased in quantity of 1 or 5. Search Aether-tech Assistant for details.\
\
Completion of Phase II summons the Aether-Tech Adept Gem Vendor â requires <20 participants\
All gems are (40 apexis) and are Unique Equipped. Search \"Aether-Tech Adept\" for details.\
\
Completion of Phase III summons the Aether-tech Master â requires 20-40. Search \"Aether-tech Master\" for details.\
\
**Phase I begins with a number of non-elite Flesh Beasts (maybe 10-15). Then the Bash'ir Flesh Fiend (72elite)(80k health) spawns.\
\
After the Bash'ir Flesh Fiend (72elite) dies an NPC arrives and fires a flare which causes the Aether-tech Assistant Potion Vendor to spawn, and begins Phase II.\
\
**Phase II begins with many (20ish) Bash'ir Subprimal (elite)(12k hp) which spawn nearby. Things become somewhat hectic at this point. It did not appear that they all attack at once, but are either pulled or proximity aggroed.\
\
After a short time, non-elite Disruptor Towers (70)(28k hp) surrounded by Bash'ir Controller (elite)(16k hp) spawn at a raged distance. The towers will fire AOE bombs on the NPC.  Using ranged DPS on the towers will minimize the number of Bash'ir Controllers aggroed during this stage. As each tower is destroyed, the four Elites arround it will aggro on the NPC.  Destroy the towers one at a time and be prepared for each group of Elites.  Destruction of the Disruptor Towers will cause the Aether-Tech Adept Gem Vendor to be summoned and begins Phase III.\
\
**Phase III begins with waves of hard-hitting elites (?Bash'ir Reckoner 36k hp?) They are immune to most/all cc and occasionally spell reflect. After a short period, the final boss The Grand Collector will spawn, however he is not targettable. He will stay at range and continually summon a bunch of harder elites, kill them off and after another couple of minutes he will rush into combat and can be attacked.\
\
Have someone tank him, and the rest of the raid needs to control the elites as they will continue to attack the NPC.  He has quite a lot of health and takes a good amount of time to go down. He doesnât hit the tank too hard, however he does an AoE that does about 1500-2500 per person, and has no target limit. Time is a factor, as this will eventually kill the NPC at the forge and end the event.\
\
After killing the Boss, the Aether-tech Master Vendor spawns. \
\
The loot table for the Boss listed on various sites is incorrect.  He may drop an Ethereum Prison Key, but any other loot listed is random world drop for this zone.",

\
The above is generally correct with a few errors. The vendor spawns are linked to the emotes of the main guy, Aether-tech Master Vendor spawned BEFORE the end significantly. We didnt even have to agro the final boss.\
\
I have uploaded pictures, keep in mind it is every even hour on the bliz timer, it is at 54,10. Also note the position of the vendors ( they can be hard to find amongst 20 players ), they are for the first 2 vendors to the side, the last is right at the pool\
\
Confirming the 2 metas that are avaliable do cost 160 apexis shards, they are bought off the FINAL vendor, not the other vendor.\

Something to note is that the flasks are purchased with apexis shards, but they do not BOP and thusly can be put in the AH.  As this quest is the only way to aquire certain ones (of the soldier, etc.) that may be a way of making some decent gold.",

\
For instance, a warrior leveling in outland has to deal with paladin plate from almost every quest reward.  A warrior gets 0 benefit from plate with intellect, spell damage, and mana regen, so shouldn't there also be a reward for him from that same quest with melee crit and AP?\
\
How about a hunter who does a quest and gets a piece of mail from the quest reward with caster stats as well, like spell damage and spell crit?  Where is his quest reward with agi and ranged AP?\
\
Basically, what anyone who argues that the quest rewards for this specific quest are bad are saying that the vast majority of quests in Outlands and the entire game are bad because they don't provide enough variety.  Some quests give rewards that are designed for some classes.  Some aren't.  Not every quest is going to give you an item thats specific for your class and build (which is the same for every other class and build in the game).",

To keep the poison shots to a minimum, move your camera angle behind the sifter (they always sink and reappear behind you) so when they start to go down into the ground you can turn and run towards them as they reappear.

Using the crystal/hill as a brace I was uninterrupted for the 6 or 7 minutes it took me to kill him (resto shammies: we've never killed anything quickly ;) ).\
\
He's definitely soloable as a resto shammie, and hence probably also as a holy pally. No elementals used - just grind him into the ground, take out the adds as they pop & out heal him. I did use a mana pot for safety's sake, but I didn't really need it (finished on ~3500 mana).",

\
This chain begins differently depending on whether you're Alliance (A) or Horde (H):\
\
[b]Alliance[/b] - starts in Wildhammer Stronghold from [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21774]Zorus the Judicator[/url]:\
1. (A) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10642][69] A Ghost in the Machine[/url]\
2. (A) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10643][69] Harbingers of Shadowmoon[/url]\
3. (A) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10644][70] Teron Gorefiend - Lore and Legend[/url]\
\
[b]Horde[/b] - starts in Shadowmoon Village from [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21772]Chief Apothecary Hildagard[/url]:\
1. (H) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10624][69] A Haunted History[/url]\
2. (H) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10625][69] Spectrecles[/url]\
3. (H) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10633][70] Teron Gorefiend - Lore and Legend[/url]\
\
At this point the chain splits into three parts which can be done in any order (and by both factions):\
4a. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10635][70] Divination: Gorefiend's Cloak[/url]\
4b. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10636][70] Divination: Gorefiend's Truncheon [2 players][/url]\
4c. [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10634][70] Divination: Gorefiend's Armor [5 players][/url]\
\
After collected Gorefiend's stuff and returned it to the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21797]spirit[/url], you will get:\
5. (A) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10645][70] Teron Gorefiend, I am...[/url]\
5. (H) [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10639][70] Teron Gorefiend, I am...[/url]\
\
For this final quest, Gorefiend becomes your \"pet\" and you control him using a pet bar.  Having used him to kill Karsius, you return to Zorus or Hildagard to claim your reward.  Choose from:\
[url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31104]Evoker's Helmet of Second Sight[/url] (cloth DPS headpiece)\

The tube near the transporter in the middle of this area needs to fill up with (5-6, can't remember) yellow balls, which appear when you kill any of the Ethereals in the area.You need to kill two Ethereals to get one of the yellow balls to pop up. The large yellow blobs that hover from the corpse of the Ethereal toward the tube have some travel time. so don't get frustrated if the tube isn't filling up at a rate you're happy with.\
\
Alliance and Horde both have a quest to summon the Nexus-Prince, so if run you into a Orc/Night Elf and you're a Human/Forsaken(depending on the situation, many combinations of inter-racial meetings could happen here, let's have fun naming them all!), you might want to consider not killing each other, because both of your kills add toward filling the tube, and in the end you both get to grab your Collection of Souls.",

\
Basically I start out as far away from the quest giver as I can while facing the direction I'm going to go with the Ram Racing Reins bound to a key so I can spam it easily while moving with my mouse for direction. I spam the Ram Racing Reins to keep a gallop all the way to the apple barrel by the bridge (it will reset without you having to stop) and over the small hill and then right as I go over the hill I stop pressing my key binding. When I reach the tiny stone wall on the ground by the road I turn around (he throws the keg even if I don't go all the way to him). When I reach the hill again on my way back I will begin to canter automatically since I haven't been spamming my keybinding. I canter all the way back to the apple barrel by the bridge, usually pressing the key binding for the Ram Racing Reins periodically to slowly swap between gallop and canter, just enough not to get exhausted. When I reach the apple barrel I start spamming my Ram Racing Reins again to gallop all the way back and repeat.\
\
(start) ->\
apple barrel by bridge -> over hill (stop using reins) -> turn around at stone wall -> over hill (begins canter) -> apple barrel by bridge -> turn in turn around and repeat\
\
It took a while to get used to, but this is faster than galloping between all the apple barrels. I used my bank alts to practice with. Before I reached around 30 tickets galloping the entire way, but this way it is possible to get around 50. Another good trick to shave a tad more time off of the trips is that when you are about to turn around; adjust the camera so you can see behind your character with your left mouse button, then turn around suddenly by clicking your right mouse button behind you. This should make you do a complete 180 without missing a step or wasting time moving in a half-circle. Although I cannot prove it, seems to me that the Riding Crop works on the Brewfest mount too.",

The Unofficial Official Way to do This Quest Quicklyâ¢\
\
1. Obtain this quest\
2. Obtain quest \"Menacing Marshfangs\" ( http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=9791 )\
3. Head to The Dead Mire\
4. Find Sporewing (Spawns at 76, 45 every time)\
\
Now, the quickest way to do this is to kill Sporewing, obviously, and then wait for him to respawn.  My luck with the Spore Bat Eyes killing *just* Sporewing over and over again was approximately 60%*.  It didn't take me long to figure out that this mob has a 150 second (2.5 minute) respawn.  Every time you kill him (Or any regular Spore Bat), you receive a buff called \"Energizing Spores\", which lasts 5 minutes.  As soon as you kill Sporewing, either find Fen Striders or Marshfang Rippers.  You will be able to kill approximately 1-2 of either of these mobs before Sporewing respawns, depending on what's around and how fast your mount is.  When your buff reads 3 minutes left, go back to his respawn, and he either should respawn shortly, or he just got there.  Either way, you're almost guaranteed the kill.  Rinse, lather, repeat.  You'll have both quests done within the hour*.\
\
5.  Chances are, you'll have the eyes finished before you have the tentacles, so finish up the Fen Striders, which drop chance isn't nearly as painful as regular Spore Bats.\
6.  Thank yourself for coming to this site and reading this stupid, bloated guide.\

The trick is to keep moonfiring him within that 2 minute window so you get the kill and the loot. I got him down to about 80% by moonfiring alone and ducking round the corner.\

\
The trick is to use the east tunnel that leads into the Auchindoun.  Kill the clefthoof near the tunnel so you don't have to travel far to get there once the worm spawns.  Once it spawns, you want to run down the ramp and get positioned so that you can quickly strafe behind the wall out of line of sight once he begins casting his ranged poison attack.\
\
If you are positioned correctly, you will not take any damage whatsoever because he can not pop up from under you if you are deep enough inside the tunnel.  \
\
You get a few seconds in between each ranged poison attack to do some damage.  It took me about a minute to finish him off using this method.",

\
When I got him to spawn, I sprinted out of range and out of combat; beware, he'll dive into the earth and resurface near you once or twice until you get out of range.\
\
I then waited until the 1:50 mark before re-engaging him. I spamed a couple of Sinister Strikes and then popped Kidney Shot to keep myself alive. I managed without a healing pot, but I would recommend one.\
\
A note, you can stun him but you cannot Cheap Shot him. Once you get out of combat range, he will go underground like the patrolling worms you normally see. The only way to get him up is to unstealth near/on him.\

A list by Greengoo\
\
1. Kindness\
- Kill 8 Rocknail Flayers, Use Carcasses to Feed 8 Dragons (don't move!). Also make sure to travel a bit when laying the meat, as the same drakes won't eat twice in a row.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10804\
\
2. Seek Out Neltharaku\
- Fly on your mount and find Neltharaku, he patrols slowly around Dragonmaw about a few hundred feet up. You'll have to be about 5 yards UNDER him to talk to him.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10811\
\
3. Neltharaku's Tale\
- Listen to story.\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10814\

http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10858\
\
8. Zuluhed the Whacked\

http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10872\
\
9. Ally of the Netherwing\
- Return to Mordenai, you will immediately gain 42,000 rep and become neutral.\

\
10. ????\
- Blizzard has announced that next patch they will be introducing a continuence of this quest line, including the ability to get exalted and purchase or receive through extensive questing an EPIC netherdrake mount. You will need epic training to use it however, so save your gold!",

\
When flying on your mount, watch out for http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=21719.  They can and will attack you on your flying mount if you get too close.  They have a 'Shoot' attack that hit my mage for about 400 damage each, and Serpent Sting, and they will whale on you for about 400 damage too if you're in melee range.  However, they won't chase you if you fly away from them (although they will continue to attack you until you're out of range).\
\
When on the ground, watch out for http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22253#M0z (in fact, look to see if any are in sight before dismounting).  They hit like two-ton trucks.  Luckily, they're like 15 feet tall so they're easy to spot.\

Im a lvl 66 BM hunter\
\
The first part of the quest where you need to collect the 20 skulls is the parts which takes the longest time.\
The skulls have around 50% drop chance, so you need to kill around 40 mobs, and if you dont have anything stop healing, which i didnt have, then the healing ones takes ages to kill.\
\
In the middle - where you need to summon him, there are 4 mobs. Kill them as the last mobs before you summon him. Due to the short respawn time its important that they are killed right before you summon him, otherwise they come during the fight - happened to me the first time.\
AND YOU DONT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN!\
If you loose the fight, the 20 skulls are gone, and he flies away again. So avoid that!\
\
About the actual figth with him:\
He hit my lvl 66(50% dmg reduction from armor) pet for around 275-300 dmg each hit, didnt do any spells just normal hit.\
The nice part about him is that he is CC-able which is rare for an elite in his size. So i was able to trap him a few times so my pet could heal fully up.\
Nothing hard in the fight, and seems most classes are able to solo him with a potion thought it says suggested 3 players\
\
the rewards though are a bit shitty =/\
normaly when you kill an elite this size you get rare rewards, all you get here is a silly green.",

\
I soloed this as a LvL 65 Warlock with Warlords. I am Affliction with imp HS and imp Fel Armor. I sacced the void and and dotted him up then just cast shadow bolts. I had to pot once, use a healstone that healed for something around 1700 and also Death Coil for the healing. It was a VERY close fight, but I didn't get a lot of nightfall procs so I would imagine a buffed up hunter / mage could do this. \
\
A word of warning - there are guys around the summoning portal, if you kill them then wait too long (1 minute) and summon the dragon, they will spawn before the dragon lands and cause problems. As a warlock I just shadow warded through all their damage when they did because all they do is cast Shadow Bolts. Also Teribus goes nutso is you don't get aggro on him. I have seen him wonder from the mound and go pretty far south.",

Just take the two non-elites out then I stood in the middle and faerie fire'd Gorr'dim.

Use Repetence on 1 at a time and pull back, waiting for it to wear off. By the time you finish off the 1st non-elite, your repetence should be or close too off its cooldown.\
\
NOTE: If the non elite is a shaman, hug the wall that they're closest to so that you'r out of their line of sight and are forced to come to you.\
\
Once the Non-Elites are down get a few steps away from the fire. TAKE THIS STEP SLOW SO YOU DONT AGGRO THE ELITES. And place 1 brew. Once he's aggro'd, pull back to the doorway just in case you accidently move to close and aggro the elites.\

\
At this point, you are attuned and can enter Black Temple, although the chain continues and you can soon upgrade your medallion. It continues with:\

\
My strat:\
\
Root the mob, cast moonfire, faerie fire. Regrowth/rejuv then bear charge into the mob and maul away.\
\
First add spawns at 70%, kill that straight away; 2k hp and should die fast.\
\
After that add was dead, carry on mauling/mangling away. If hp does run low - bash/root run away heal, hots whatever and go back in. Kill the 2nd add that spawns as fast as possible that should be around 45% hp.\
\
After that kill the mob till he's dead then kill the spawns after. One thing I did notice is when I CCed the last spawn with nature's grasp, and finished the mob off because my health was running low, was that the spawn despawned after maybe 10-15 seconds. It might be worth someone testing this to see if all spawns disappear after 10 seconds or so. :)\
\
It's gonna be slow but they are soloable. Just be very careful where you pull, casting demo roar can pull a nearby mob to you and that is insta death for you. Move the mob to a clear area and you should have no problems at all.",

If you're trying to kill them then, make sure you kite them in a circle instead of just running away, or they'll up and evade on you.\
\
These can be soloed as a frost mage, possibly by any spec mage as long as you're good with snares. If you can't avoid aggroing the shardlings, you can use CoC/FN to root them all giving you time to nuke down the elite. The shardlings will despawn a little bit after the elite dies, so don't waste mana killing them if you can avoid it.\
\
The shardlings hit for about 225 on cloth, which is almost as much as the colossus once it splits a few times, so you can't just let them beat on you. :) A good opportunity to practice aoe kiting skills, or learn some if you don't have any!",

When the second add is spawned I have my trees summoned and treat myself with some mana (innervate or pot).\
If performed well you don't need any pots, and since I'm only a moderate boomkin I'm sure others can perform even better.\
\
Not sure if it matters a lot, but I was wearing quite a few feral pieces. Had only 150(!) spell damage and my starfires were hitting for ~850. \
The 200+ agi and ~5500 HP were certainly nice when I had 3 mobs hitting me. Usually 1 mob was focusing on my trees though. With barkskin/natures grace I could take out the others. \

So yes, if you're Scryer, you'll get Scryer rep. The only reason Wowhead says that you'll get Aldor rep is because this quest page is for the Aldor version of the quest.\

I would initiate stop and fight them as they run in and another NPC would sneak in the other side and restart the process.\
\
The easiest way i found to do this IF your a Melee Fighter was. Get full health and start shutdown. As the NPC's keep running in all you have to do is just play defence defending the controol while its in the 2 min shutdown. Don't try to kill and the NPC if you dont have to. JUst aggro tag them on hit and keep moving around to tag all the NPC's as they run in, but keep an eye out to see the NPC's as they run in and tag all of them. They all will be fighting you and thats what you want, them fighting you and not trying to restart the sequence. So just keep them occupied long enough for the 2 min sequence to finish. When its at Zero you will hear it and see it in your text log, then you can kill off the NPC's if most not alreasy dead. Easiest way as a Melee fighter i did all these shutdown quest and all in one rolling fight. Hope it helps some one else.",

It's a very difficult quest. My group (high 60s, two 70s) cleared Tombs without a problem, but we wiped hard on this escort quest. By that time everyone was tired of Tombs and gave up... not that we could get the quest again without resetting the instance anyway. Blizz needs to tune this quest.",

- all party members who have completed the pre-req quest will get credit for the escort quest, regardless of whether or not they initiate the encounter\

- the event is *not* difficult if the group uses good crowd control, coordination, and focus fire (namely all the group tactics that allow you to finish mana tombs in the first place)\
\
- it consists of 2-3 5 mob spawns in different areas as the NPC moves back to the entrance of the instance, followed by a relatively easy boss encounter (easier than any in the instance)\
\
- the NPC will give you a 30 second break (without moving) before the final boss encounter, giving anyone who died during some of the trash mob spawns to run back if necessary\
\
- ensure the instance is completely clear from the quest initiation point to the entrance of the instance; it will make things go a lot smoother\
\
- as far as I can tell the boss at the end does not drop anything of note (i.e. a trash mob loot table)\

1st attempt failed. Essentially the mobs in the second fight spawned close and fast and we wiped. Was a very balanced group but once the priest went down ... fubar!\
\
Quest remained as failed - I just removed it. \
\
2nd attempt worked we were more prepared; as a feral druid tanking I managed to get all aggro on me so healer concentrating on me with MA peeling them off. \
\
3rd attempt Failed.. For some reason the engineer in the middle of the infamous 2nd fight fight walked off! We think its because that we fought a little ways back from him and thus as with ll escort quests you get too far away from him and *poof* quest fails!\
\
This quest has similar analogies withthe ways mob spawn as the escort quest from the \"Shadow Tomb\" http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10887. In other words, unlike *old world quests* having tramled a path through the mobs to get the quest would normally mean it's clear; thus that quest enforces mobs to spawn on the way out and in the open meaning that unless you go slightly ahead you have respawns and quest mobs to deal with.\
\
I would suggest that \
a) Always clear every mob! Personally I prefer to kill the last boss for those with the quest. Saves time, and no reason to enter after an escort wipe.\
\
b) Be prepared - 2nd fight seesm to be the worst. Lay traps and have CC peeple ready. No time for Priest MC - they should be targetting the main tank who shoul dbe trying to keep aggro. Rest of group following the Main Assist. \
\
c) Between fights ensure mana people drink!! If duid is in group get them to innervate after 1st fight as that has least time for drinking; also allowing recylcle before final fight.\
\
Once second fight comlpete get ahead to fight 2 Nexus Terrors ahead leaving clear run through to final fight in the first dungeon room.\

I love this quest! It has taken the monotony out of escort quests! You have to be prepared, you have to think and act on your feet. \

After you've cleared it once (which scores some pretty good loot), clear your way inside the burned down building (the biggest one) to kill Shadowmaster Grieve. \

Turns out these buggers each have a 20-25% chance to drop an Unidentified Plant, and being they are all 1/4 of a regular mob, to AoE them down in a sense technically quadruples your chance of finding an Unidentified Plant.\

I farmed these guys in bear form with no hassle and hit some mobs of 4 with no drops, to tanking a mob of 8 getting 7 drops...the odds are in your favor if you're out for the Grinding of Unidentified Plants.\

    "1107890258500902582007/05/25 12:49:21aasartorHere's some detailed information about the dragon fights for this quest:\
\
There are a total of four dragons that you can summon for this quest - Rivendark, Obsidia, Furywing, and Insidion.  Any one of these four dragons will drop the Dragon Teeth quest item needed to finish the quest.  I felt that Rivendark was the easiest of the four, so I would recommend killing him first.  However, all four dragons are fairly easy - all of them can be killed in a reasonable time frame by a group of three people or more (tank, dps, healer)\
\
Rivendark can be summoned at (27, 64).  \
Obsidia can be summoned at (34, 54).\
Furywing can be summoned at (66, 14).\
Insidion can be summoned at (62, 7).\
\
All four dragons are nearly identical.  They are basically Onyxia clones tailored for groups of size 3-5 people.  They all possess the following abilities:\
\
Melee Attack - hit the tank for about 450-600 damage\
Cleave - standard cleave attack\
Flame Breath - frontal cone attack for about 600 fire damage\
Tail Swipe - knockback effect from the tail of the dragon (similar to Onyxia's).  Our fury warrior kept getting knocked backwards right off the ledge.\
Bellowing Roar - AoE fear, similar to Onyxia's\
\
Along with the afore mentioned abilities, each dragon possess exactly one unique ability:\
\
Rivendark - casts Corruption on random party members; identical to a warlock's Corruption\
Obsidia - casts Hellfire; identical to a warlock's Hellfire.  The Hellfire was hitting for about 500 fire damage a tick.\
Furywing - casts Wing Buffet on the tank;  similar to Firemaw's Wing Buffet.  This ability reduces the threat on primary target by a significant amount and knocks that target back.  It's not a big deal if the tank loses aggro, since Furywing is not immune to taunt.\
Insidion - casts a stacking Flame Buffet on the entire party;  similar to Firemaw's Flame Buffet.  This ability increases fire damage taken by the party and stacks a large number of times.  Since Insidion's only fire attack is Flame Breath, the only person really getting hit with fire damage should be the tank.  Thus, Flame Buffet stacking on the rest of the group shouldn't really matter.\
\
For loot, each dragon drops a green or blue item, as well as a scale unique to that dragon (lootable by everybody in the party).  If you obtain a scale from each of the four dragons, you can create this item  http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31942#M0z.",

These Dragons are Standard Spank and Tanks. Get someone who can hold agro, and mind your own, and itâs quite easy. Recommend having a pot or 2 if youâre a dmg caster class.  Used a potion and a mana emerald on my mage, as well as evocate.  Just a long battle, not hard.  Healer looked like his mana never went below half.\

\
[b]Alliance Watch[/b]: Very High â Many Quests in this area for the Skyguard and Ogriâla. Faction. I ran into a ton, all questing, so they didnât bother me.  They also have quests in this area, so odds of attack are low, but hey, who can predict human nature.\
\
[b]Quest Rank of Ease[/b]: Average â Decent group, it isnât bad at all.  Average Group quest.  Mobs are long winded for a 4 man, approx 3-6 min fight.\

I put on my tanking gear and made sure not to kill the engineers before starting the quest. While the NPC is hammering at each pylon, there's about 10-15 seconds to kill the engineer posted there, which was fine for me.\

The imps were cake because they just deal a low amount of melee damage, something bear form is perfect for. The next group of 3 I handled similarly, with bear form and a bit of CC (nature's grasp). The third post is tricky only because there are 2 engineers posted there; still, in bear form I fought of the second engineer I couldn't kill fast enough along with the spawn.",

He zapped me once with nature damage for like 1400 (earth shock maybe?) which after a few drain/siphon life ticks was healed and he died with the felguard at 66% and me at full health.

\
Just don't forget to gather all skulls BEFORE actually enslaving felguard. Otherwise you'll waste your enslave time on farming for those. \
\
So, \
\
1. Gather skulls (clearing all the way to the summoning place while farming will help alot), \
2. Go back, enslave felguard at the Forge Camp, \
3. Mount up, ride all the way to the summoning circle (ignore angry mobs, they'll forget about you when you'll reach the place), \
4. Get your skulls heated, summon, put felguard on Gurok and \
5. Nuke him badly. \
\
(!) Don't forget to start SUMMONING staying your back to the wall, so felguard will tank the bastard in the same position. Otherwise he'll throw your felguard away. \
\
(!!) Keep your back covered too. Since in my case, he aggroed me at like 5% or so. \
\
Only used healthstone at the end of fight. Ended with 40 - 50% health on me and more than 50% (don't recall the exact amount) on felguard. 1 min fight. \
\
Easy as hell if done properly.\
\
Used: \
* 2 shards - to enslave felguard and to re-summon blue bubble after the fight\
* lvl 67 Healthstone\
* +23 spell damage buff food\
\
Possible expenses:\
* 1 more shard for soulshatter if you don't use KTM and will rip aggro from felguard too early\

It doesn't have the +51 stamina (who needs that on a fishing pole, anyway?) but it has +25 fishing. For the Alliance, however, this is a perfect fishing pole.\

As for the actual mob, they're quite easy to kill. Took me maybe 10 seconds to kill one, maybe less. They also drop Motes of Water pretty easily (I got one almost every kill), so good to farm if you're looking for Primal Water.\

Drop on the quest item sucked for me, though. About 1 in eight.",

Put up both Ice Barrier and Frost Ward (waiting until the cooldown on Ice Barrier was gone to actually pull).\

Opened with Frostbolt, then put up the Water Elemental and just kept beating on her, refreshing Ice Barrier / Frost Ward whenever I could. When the Water Elemental expired, I just used Cold Snap and put it up again, then used Iceblock to get her off me (since I was at low health by then).\
\
She only spawned one elemental, which I killed while leaving the Water Elemental to beat on her.\
\
In retrospect, one thing I should've done was put Gift of the Naaru on myself pre-pull (ignore if you're not a Draenei), and the Cold Snap + Water Elemental was fairly unnecessary - I just could not be bothered using a healing potion + mana gem. Either way, she was at roughly 12% when I Iceblocked - at 10% she ran in fear, so I removed Iceblock and finished her off.",

\
As a lvl 70 enhancement shaman, I WAS able to solo this quest, although I was very slim on mana the entire time and had to mana pot twice.  Fhwoor doesn't slow down while he is in the camp so you have to move ahead of him and clear the way before he pulls too many.\
\
When Ssslith comes out, I simply put down my Earth Elemental totem to tank the adds and popped heroism, didn't have a problem with them at all.  I would still suggest any other level 70 to bring a friend, but if you're a shaman, you're in luck for this one.  :)",

\
This quest is not soloable. (maybe at level 70)\
\
First part:\
You just need to escort Fhwoor in the same place where you do the quest to kill 12 and 12 nagas. You can make it with some bandages and a couple of potions. I soloed this part as a warrior level 63. Fhwoor is quite strong and can solo a couple of mobs. So sometimes you can let him fight and in the while you can rest to full hp/mana. Like any other NPC, Fhwoor will regen to full health within seconds.\
\
Second part:\
When Fhwoor gets his item and you're going away, just outside the naga camp will spawn Ssslith, an elite level 65 with 3 adds (2 wars and 1 enchantress). Ssslith as i saw is immune to fear and piercing howl and hits for around 1k on plate (clearly dps geared). He even does a frostnova for around 800 dmg and it's quite annoying. I suggest you to bring a couple of friends to do this.",

1) You've already done the prequests and started on your keys.  Key drop is low as stated above.  5% sounds right.\

2) All ethereals drop them, but the ones around mana forge ultris seem to have the best drop rate.\
\
3) They are SELLABLE.  Do not make these cheap as they are a pain in the ass, as below...\
\
4) You hand in your first key and get your follow up.  5 Keys.\
\
5) Hand in 5 keys, and go to Bashir's Landing in BEM (North)\
\
6) Open Stasis Chamber Alpha and fight an 80,000 hp Gronn.  Does a knockback attack (probably aggro wiping, but i dont know...) and a daze attack, but hey Blizzard:  If you're going to make a quest say \"5 man\" dont make the mob fearable.  Solo'd the mob with a mage friend taking out repops.  8 minute fight :P\
\
7) Hand in the Gronn's drop and take the next quest.  It took several re-reads of the quest, but essentially...\
\
    Get 5 Keys\
    Hand in 5 keys for 1 bashir's landing prison key\
    Open prison and beat up mob\
    Mob has a CHANCE to drop Mark of the Nexus-King\

He can be found in the northwesternmost point of lower Shattrath with two of his buddies. Upon asking for the book he'll say a few lines and give you a countdown till he attacks you. During this countdown you are allowed to get the first shot. Dirty Larry himself is a 66 elite and his friends are 66 non elites. They are NOT immune to snaring/rooting, so kiting is a definite option if you're looking to solo this. If you kite him too far(past the nearby bank) he will reset.\

I was able to solo this guy at 64 as a frost mage, here's how I did it:\
1. Start the event.\
2. Sheep one of his friends instantly after talking to Larry.\
3. After one is sheeped, kill the other.\
4. Larry should be on you now kite him around. I used my water elemental to put up a little DPS and to help with frost nova'ing him. Keep up the kiting/dpsing till he dies -- remember to keep the other mob sheeped. I had to use cold snap and 3 frost shields.\

Blizzard has it programmed in heroics that if at any time there are more than 5 people in the instance, all quest items that would normally drop in the instance will not drop.

However, people who DC'ed or logged inside the instance counts toward that 5 person limit.\

We missed the first two prisoners but were able to kill Kargath before the third prisoner died and we still completed the quest.

I can confirm that you can get the quest item after 2 npc's have been executed. After he killed one we got a 10 minute debuff. After he killed the second one we got a 15 minute debuff. Tips for clearing are watch out for assassin after the first boss while clearing through the hallway full of archers and spawns. The 2nd boss with 2 archers is simple to kill and his adds are pretty weak if you want to kill them first. Don't rush yourselves into a wipe, because theres a enough time for a slow steady clear.",

I killed so many and none dropped until I noticed that the drop is called \"ether energized flesh\" - so it makes sense that it has something to do with energy. Basically, go around to where the pink energizers are, and monitor when the fiendlings go to it, you have a guarantee drop if you attack the fiendling *while* it is being energized. It is yellow and then it goes to one of the energizers, pink lightning comes out and then the fiendling becomes enraged. I had no trouble once I figured that out! While you go around monitoring when they are being energized, just kill mobs in the area so they don't zerg you.",
