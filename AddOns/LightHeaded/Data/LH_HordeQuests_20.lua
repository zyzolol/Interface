So we all know where this girl is (if you don't, just click on her name here on wowhead). We also know where this Sludge Fen is. Now, the thing is - there are quite few Tool Buckets that contain these Nugget Slugs and their respawn (Bucket's, that is) is very long. The respawn rate of the mobs around, to the contrary, is extremely low, something like below 3 minutes. To make things worse, they are runners and quite fast ones.\
\
When looking back, I'd probably advise you not to take this quest (and any in or around Sludge Fen), as the corpse runs are not worth it. I died a few times, being 16 druid with above average (not twink) gear.\

This can be pretty easy and you dont actually need to kill anything to do it. \

Stealth into the village and find the inn at around 43,73. Sneaking inside and up the stairs wont always be a problem (there was only two mobs in there when I went). Go into the third door from your left. Sap the guard (giving you about 20 seconds) and then run in to Berard's room. Slumber powder him and half inch (pinch) the journal.\
\
Then peg it outside, dropping back to stealth if you can (evasion worked for me).\

If you die after getting the book (I got stuck on the doorway and killed) then take your ghost round the back of the inn and resurect there. You can go into stealth mode again and sneak around the wall of the village to get out.",

If you walk up the path leading to Agamand Mills Nissa's remains will be inside the first house you see.\
To get her remains you will need to kill Nissa Agamand (lvl 10).\
\
Cord's: (49,35)\
\
Gregor's Remains\
\
From Nissa's Remains walk north west to a wind mill and kill Gregor Agamand (lvl 10).\
\
Cord's: (47,30)\
\
After i killed him at the above cord's I noticed him walking around at (43,30) so if no luck at first set of cord's try this one. :)\
\
Thurman's Remains\
\
Walk South West to another wind mill located next to a clif face and kill Thurman Agamand (lvl 10)\
\
Cord's: (42,33)\
\
Note All of these targets seem to walk around there above area's.\
Also there are normaly Darkeye Bonecaster's with them.\

Very quick respawn time too.",

Then again, if you alone can't handle 2 lvl 18's on you, don't even try, as there will be times, when 3 will come at you or 2 and 1 shortly after them.

    "15248063050806302007/05/09 23:17:32AstrillianThe crappy set up for this quest forced me to dedicate better than 2 hours in its completion, so I hope this information serves to save each of you time and energy.  The guy you need is tough to find but follow these directions and you won't go wrong:\
\
Follow the river on the western edge of Durotar until you hit a rock wall that would force you into the water if you tried to go any further.  Once you're at that rock wall you look up a bit and you'll find a rectangular gray stone with symbolic markings.  Next to that large stone is a faint trail that winds through the mountain to the top where you'll find the NPC you need.\
\
Once you find the NPC he'll tell you to get two items.  The fire tar is also a reagent, so you can get that item from a reagent vendor in Orgrimmar.  The second item is a pouch that drops from the Burning Blade Cultists (and only the cultists).  These guys were tough to find as well, so the key is to go due east out of Razor hill, and then immediately turn north.  Do not go into the ravine.  Do not take the trail north to orc city.  You have to stay up above the ravine, and you will see the cave where the cultists (an others) reside.",

Telf Joolam is in Durotar, not The Barrens. To get access to him, you follow the road leaving Durotar into The Barrens, but taker a left instead of crossing the bridge. Keeping running until you a small black rock at the foot of a mountain, around 36, 57. Follow the windy path up the mountain and talk to Telf, who is at 38, 58.",

You can get a second earth sapta by talking to the guy who gives you the quest in the beginning area",
    "1524205104202051042007/12/21 14:39:20RedhandjaneOk, to clear this up even more. You get the quest in The Barrens. From the quest giver, turn west and go back the way you just came, back to Durotar. When you cross the bridge, turn left, or south, and follow the river until you come to the mountain. If you are next to the river you can't miss the little path with its black rock marker. I hope this helps unconfuse someone.",

\
Head to just a bit Southwest of the Stagnant Oasis (which is the one SE of the Crossroads) and hit the raptor nests for this quest. Now, as mentioned, the feather drop rate is somewhat hideous. But! Don't get discouraged, because, along with this quest, you can be working on Intact Raptor Horns (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=685) ... but, just a little run to the Southeast of the raptor nests, to about 58,53, are the Raptor Grounds, where, if you stay along the very left-hand mountain/wall, you can move in with minimal fighting, and grab the Stolen Silver (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=3281) ... seems the raptors top out at level 18, though I'm sure there will be to occasional level 19 in there, just to prove me wrong. Also, any of these raptors can drop horns AND feathers for the Nest quest.\
\
\
And, if you're up to it, just a smidge further to the east, along the coast, is Northwatch Hold, where you can also do Stolen Booty (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=888), from Ratchet, and, if you're of decent level, you can do The Guns of Northwatch (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=891) also from Ratchet. And, in Northwatch Hold, I believe there's also an escort quest you can pick up ... but that one I'd really suggest level 17+.\

You will then see two other towers, one to your left and one to your far right. Both of these hold the other 2 Cannoneers you need to slay.

Also, once you have completed this quest, be sure to visit the first tower again, and talk to the prisoner at the bottom of the tower. You will be able to accept an escort quest, \"Free From the Hold\" http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=898, where you will have to lead him all the way back to Ratchet.

\
Also note that in the first tower you encoutner after entering Northwatch, there will be a Blood Elf (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=3465) that wants you to escort him back to Ratchet. It is suggested that you wait to do the escort until after you have killed all three leaders.

\
1. Zalazane walks back and forth. His path leads him to the top of the hill where Minshina's skull is.\
2. Important: there is another ramp (I'll call the \"Back door\") opposite to the one he walks up. This one is less conspicuous and is the one you should walk up to fight him.\
3. At the bottom of the Back door is a Hexed Troll and a Raptor.\
4. They are separated far enough for you to take down individually.\
5. After taking them out, walk up the Back door and patiently wait for him to return to the top.\
6. Confront him isolated from his henchman.\
\
I recommend you to be on level 8 or higher to maximise your chances of winning if you solo. He casts a nasty 2 minute curse which reduces your strength and stamina by 3. Here would be a good opportunity to blow your cooldowns and potions if the going gets tough.",

\
I'm thinking most of the time when you go to tackle this quest you'll be 2 or 3 levels lower than Zalazane.  The key is to watch his walking path.  He will do a small walk around the camp, then walk up a small ledge where he will stop, turn around then go back down & continue his walking.  \
\
If you get inbetween the camp and the water you'll be able to pull him alone without any problems from adds.  Either make sure you fight on top of the small ledge or get him down to the beach.",

\
The Voodoo Troll's will use one of two spells during the fight, lightning shield and healing wave.  They may use both depending on how long the fight goes.  If you have some kind of interrupt spell at level eight'ish, use it when they try to heal.  The fight and drag out for very long if it's not used.\
\
Zalazane is pretty easy.  He doesn't do much damage, but will heal.  Make sure to interrupt that.  Additionally, he may use a shrink curse on you that reduces strength and stamina.  It's not much to be worried about as he is still killable even after cursed.",

But got my butt kicked on my lvl 11 Shamman, and had to come back later at 14. Hunters and Locks should have it easy, other classes may have trouble.\
\
Also, you don't have to fight through all the Thunder Lizzards if you don't want to, just drop down into the canyon right at the entrance to Fizzle's cove. There are some rock outcroppings so you don't have to drop all the way at once and lose a lot of health. Hunters and locks don't forget to dismiss your pet first and resummon at the bottom.\
\
I recommend killing the imp first it you can.  It dishes a lot of damage, but is easily killed, removing its dps from the equation.  Then pot or heal and finish off Fizzle.  Of course, like everyone else has suggested, wait for Fizzle to leave the campfire and walk back to the back of the camp, then pull and clear all the adds from around the campfire.  Then do Fizzle when he comes back and amusingly fails to notice all his guards are dead.",

\
Remember the skull that you got rewarded from the Minshina's Skull quest? Save it up to use on Fizzle. At maximum power, it sucks 125 hp from him and recharges you with the same amount. When timed correctly, that can be a 250 hp turnaround and a game breaker.\
\
Remember that if you are an Orc, use this BEFORE you use Blood Fury to maximise its effect. And lastly, take out the imp first. Good luck.",

If you die, your corpse run is from the graveyard close to Org. I found that if I jumped down into Thunder Ridge from above, I had to follow the canyon for a bit and then LEFT to find Fizzle (and my body...)",

The second wave is just as easy, let the npc tank both and wand down it's target.\

The third and fourth waves are harder, let the npc tank 2 of them and chuck a SW:P on it's target. Then choose one of the other mobs to kill, kiting it up and down with SW:P + renew/PW:S.

I had the engineering gogs with +8 stam and some greens from the AH. I also used one of those bombs that deal about 140 dmg and stun the target for 2 secs, but I still couldnt do it alone.\
\
First of all, the Orc and the VW near the chest are both lvl14, orange to you. You wont be landing spells on them very often, the VW resisted about 50% of my fears and there were times when I could not land a single DoT on the Orc before I died. If the VW resists your first fear, you will probably die, because I had about 400 health and when my first fear got resisted the mobs had enough time to beat me down to 20-30%.",
    "1501184787101847872007/11/15 01:19:28atomicvampireI've done this twice now and have found a pretty simple way to do it.  Bring plenty of food and drink, 10 each should do.\
\
On the lower level lock/VW pairs, open with a corruption on the lock and have your imp start attacking about a half second after you start casting.  Followup up with an immolate, then 1-2 shadowbolts.  You'll be tanking the VW during this, and even in grays/whites you should be around half health or so when the lock drops.  Now have your imp attack the VW and pull it off of you, then drop a CoA, corruption, immolate on the VW and followup with a shadowbolt.  You can melee it down from there provided you get no resists, and you and your imp should both survive the fight, albeit low on health.  Eat/drink and move on.\
\
If you don't mind dying (and it's much faster to), then when you get to the 14s get close, but not too close.  Have the imp attack the lock, and as soon as the firebolt lands, run over and loot the chest.  This takes a little bit of timing, because you need to start running over to the chest as soon as the lock starts casting and the VW aggros on your imp.  This is why you don't want to get as close as possible, because the imp is going to die before the chest is open and you need enough distance from the VW to finish looting.  It helps if you autoloot.  Then start running out along the southernmost path and hug the wall, you should be able to rez from outside the cave if you do so.\

then summoned the void walker (had a health stone ready, Killed it and ran as fast as i could to the bridge and out of there. Mobs in the area are Melee type class with melee damage so hits extra on cloth (us warlocks) They are immune to Fear so you cannot crowd control.\

Essentially this quest was designed to prove that you need a tank at your side AKA Void walker. So the moral of the story is 'Use your void walker to take the damage'\

Anyhow just my 2 cents\

Unless you're a class with a pet, this quest is tedious, but manageable. I recommend doing this quest at level 10 along with The Venture Co (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=764).\

The Arcane Wraiths are found all over the tower; work your way upwards, killing the Arcane Wraiths as you go. The Tainted Arcane Wraiths wander around the higher levels of the tower. Continue travelling upwards; you will reach a large, circular platform. Felendren is often found kneeling right in the centre of the circle. Be careful when you engage him in combat; sometimes the surrounding Arcane Wraiths and Tainted Arcane Wraiths join in the fight! The best way to prevent a messy situation is to pull and kill the nearby Wraiths before attacking Felendren himself.\

Warlord Krom'zar appears on the southern side as far as I can tell, and he comes with his two buddies. The best strategy is to fight only in the south battle so as to get the upper hand with the NPC's on your team. If the Kolkar are outnumbered when Krom'zar appears, then the NPCs can help you with damage and aggro.\

The biggest thing to watch out for is the casters that cast Lightning Cloud. It is an aoe attack that will completely destroy any kind of upper had that you can have by wasting your NPC's. If you are careful of that then getting the upper hand is possible. \
\
Overall the best strategy is to just get another lvl 20 or so to help you with the quest. No matter what happens, usually 2 people can DPS him down before he kills them both.",

Some advice, watch out for him, he can sneak up on you and kill you real fast with being an Elite and all. He hit me once as a priest and he must have crit, brought me down to below 50(HP).\
One more piece of advice... Unless you're a class that can heal itself, I would bring a friend; It's Solo-able if you know what you're doing, but if it's your first time and you don't have atleast someone there to help, you're likely to drop dead D:",

\
Get the southern fight thinned out.  Hunter's mark a bodyguard and lay a trap.  When Krom'zar and guards are fighting orcs, hit Krom'zar with a sting and then dps down the marked guard.  Krom'zar and the other guard will probably kill off the rest of the orcs and come for you.  Drop a trap, concussive shot Krom'zar, sting the guard and put the pet on the guard.  Run away from the battle toward the south. The trap, pet and sting should kill the bodyguard, leaving just Krom'zar for you to kite using jump-spin concussive shots and a run-through wing clip if he gets too close.  He'll follow you pretty far, so make a wide loop south of the road.  Kite and dps using pet (taunt OFF), traps, and jump-spin sting and arcane shots.",

Probally because I used bad strategy. As angelFlonne suggested take the IMP out first, I partied with one of my guildies which was a mage lvl 21, he sheeped Thule and we killed the imp quickly then finished his other 2 adds. Since i'm a priest  I just bubbled my mage and kept healing him throwing dots etc on Thule it was actually quite easy 2 manning.",

It is the only building on the island is it is covered with many lvl 17-19 rothides. It's a great way to earn some xp points if you want to kill them all. I opted to just knock out the quest. \
\
Thule is located on the second floor in a large room. He has a lvl 20 demon with him and one lvl 19 rothide. I sapped Thule, killed the demon, and then killed the rothide. The demon is very weak but he does deal out some hit points on you so I suggest you get ride of him first to make the whole operation go smooth. Thule is easy. Once I killed him and left with his head and stayed stealth on my exfill.",

Rez pet, attacked his Imp, frost trapped add. Mend pet and put all damage on Thule. Ignore the add when it popped and retrapped it. Keep your pet alive and you can kill Thule in time for your pet to aggro on the last add after the second trap breaks. Certainly not the easy way to do it, but it's possible.",

\
He's located on the second floor of the main keep-like building on Fenris Isle. There are a quite a few 18 and 19 mobs in and around the keep, sometimes 2 at a time.\
\
He's a level 24 elite, with a 24 imp (not a lot of HP at all, go for him first). There are also 2 of the regular 18 or 19 guys right by him. First, I cleared the whole top floor. Then I killed one of the normal guys by him, and ran around the top floor until I dropped agro. Then I did the same thing for the second normal guy. After that I killed the elite. I used everything I had against him, including a pot, and just barely made it.\
\
All in all, its probablly better to do this one in a small group, or at a somewhat higher level.",
    "442706141135832007/04/21 17:59:31zhekAlso managed to do it at 23, as a rogue. The biggest advice really is simply clear the room before hand. Clearing all the way down to the stairway below helped. Try not to die, the time between attempts when dead more then likely'll cause something to repop. One mob down, move down the stairs till they deaggro, repeat.\
\
He tries to keep Immolate up on you, which if possible should be kicked. He also does a nasty melee/spell reduction debuff, but assuming you kept your potion from the previous quest you should have a counter to that. It didn't seem to set off the potion timer but I think drinking a potion that DOES makes it so you can't drink the debuff remover until the timer goes back up.",

For the second guy simply pick a quiet hour on your server and walk on the road from Hillsbrad through Arathi. I did it first time at lvl 20 no problem. Took me 10 minutes. Just carefully wait and walk past any mobs that wander close to the path. If you aggro, set the VW on them and walk on. Simply sacrifice the VW then to continue unscathed.

Turns out you have to go north of the Undercity entrance  to a tower where you take a zepplin flying machine to Orgrimmar. I accidentally got on the wrong one that took me to Stranglevale (a nice surprise for me), but no worry, there is one there that takes you to Orgrimmar (be sure to pick up flight path when you meet Zankaja, it is a short distance from her).\

use your imp to pull the mobs, then immolate, corruption, coa them and finish them off with wand or sword, don't forget to drain soul, make your minor healthstone and use it when needed.

Dearest Yvette,\
\
I will entrust this letter to our fastest runner.  I pray he can find a way through the forces surrounding us.  And I pray you read these words, for they are the last you will hear of me.\
\
My only comfort in these dark days is the relief I feel, knowing that you are free of my fate.\
\
I fear my father made a grave error when he decided to remain and defend our home.  The forces of the Scourge rage through Tirisfal Glades, and although we are well fortified and well stocked, after the betrayal of my brother Devlin we lack the strength and numbers to withstand their continued assault.\
\
If you receive this letter, Yvette, then know that Devlin is a traitor.\
\
Devlin despaired and sought an escape from our ill fortunes, and in doing so he made a pact with the Scourge.  I do not know what price was promised him for his betrayal, but I'm sure it was laced with lies.\
\
If you see my brother, then flee from him.  He is a fiend.  A few nights ago he murdered two of our watchmen and let a small group of Scourge through the breach.  Leading them to where many more of us slept.\
\
Their ambush was brutal.  They slew a third of us before we could take them down.  Now, we barely have enough men to watch our borders.  It is only a matter of time before our wearying guard drops and the Scourge attack.\
\
And although I saw Devlin's face amidst the desperate men and gaunt-faced Scourge on that cursed night, he slipped away before I could catch him.  He might be dead, or he might still live as an agent of the Scourge.\
\
Either way, he is a monster.\
\
Devlin warned us that if we tried to face the Scourge, then we were doomed.  He told us this when they first entered Tirisfal Glades, well before they encircled our home.  Perhaps he was pleading with us to leave, or perhaps he was gloating.\
\
It was always hard to understand Devlin's motives.  Since he was a child, he was a mystery to us.\
\
But he was right.  We are doomed.  The Agamand family line will end.  Although I still live, I know I will soon be dead.\
\
I am not afraid, and I do not regret remaining with my family. But my last thoughts will be of you.\
\
Live on, my beloved Yvette, and I will find peace.\
- Thurman\
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\
\
Yvette's reaction:\
\
Oh... my poor Thurman!  I begged him to leave Agamand Mills with me and my father, but his family loyalty was too strong!  And I knew it!  I just know it that Brand meant him harm!!  Oh, curse this Plague, and the Scourge!\
\
<Yvette's face then smooths and grows cold.>\
\
But regrets are for the weak.  As a Forsaken, I have new goals and love is not one of them.  I would thank you for delivering this letter, for I had wondered what happened to my past love.\
\
But that life is over.  Forever.",

I can endlessly grind against mobs my level, but these guys do entirely too much damage for their level.  Then again, it's not insane, so let's just say they're not the best grinding mobs.\

Keep in mind these mobs also have a chance to drop a quest-starting item called [The Lady's Necklace] (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22597), which is basically a \"Take this item to this guy and get some experience\" quest.

On another note, I can also confirm the mobs' power. I just did this quest today and kept killing the mobs to get The Lady's Necklace. I was a level 18 rogue and ended up getting killed by the Fallen Rangers. This was at the point where I had killed around 10 more mobs than the ones needed for the quest, and it made me give up.

Couple of things to note: 1) As with other escort quests, there are occasions where mobs don't attack. They'll just follow along behind for awhile. This can save you the trouble of killing them, however, if the escortee stops (such as for an 'ambush' or to fight a different mob), the ones following will attack. 2) There are no ambushes on this escort quest, there won't be a time where 2 or 3 come out of nowhere.

 Go to the apothecary district and look for the expert alchemist and alchemy supplier and use the scroll to see the elementals. It can spawn 2-4 of these elementals so try to kite one away but be sure to bring it back to where they spawn in order to contain the stunned elemental.\
\

Stay on the steps (top of the steps is fine) and right click on the scroll.  One ghost will spawn closer to you than the others.  Do your frost nova so you ONLY get one in the trap.  Then run, the other 3 will follow you a very short way, then they will disappear.\

As soon as they disappear, the 4th one (the one you trapped) will be after you.  Kite it back to the store, and kill it there (easiest way is frost nova again inside the area, then blast it).  Capture it in the containment coffer (by right clicking on the box in your stash), it will suck the spirit into the coffer, and you right click once more on the coffer on the floor.\

\
Start between the alchemist shop and the bridge/moat.  Inch closer to where Algernon (the shopkeeper) is standing, casting Arcane Explosion as you go.  Eventually you will catch one of the Rift Spawns in the AOE, it'll aggro.  Just do the standard mage thing - Fire Blast, Frost Nova, Ice Bolt, Fireball, Fire Blast again - quite easy when it's alone. Once it's stunned, throw down a coffer and you're 1/3.\

Rinse and repeat.\

To get the 5 earthroot, just use the Herb gathering skill (If you have it) if you don't have it then you can do 1 of 4 things. Ask someone in your guild if they can get them for you, if you don't have a guild you can get them from vendors in the Cities that are close to the Herb / Alch. trainers, check in the Auction Houses, or ask in the trade channel in a major city.

So! My very own summary.\
To find the cultists:\
From Razor Hill go north out of the camp. Immediately past the last building in camp, hang a right off the road and follow the curve of the ravine around. There's a path that leads up to top of the ravine (53, 38). Continue north--you'll run directly to the mouth of a cave. Yes, there are mobs there hanging around the front of the cave that -aren't- cultists.\
Don't fret!\
I thought I was in the wrong area too. They're inside the cave, to the left when following the path. First cultist dropped it for me.\
(Incidentally, don't be like me and spend an hour in the cave near Orgrimmar. You'll end up scratching your head and wondering why none of the mobs in there are cultists. :3 )",

If you're in Razor Hill, run in the direction of Orgrimmar, but take a right once you get to the end of the buildings. There will be a hill that you can go up and that will take you up top. Keep running in the direction of Orgrimmar and you'll see a cave with some orcs guarding it.",

It's a quest, you may as well do it, however hard it may be. It doesn't matter if it's 'inferior'. Certain items equipped by you are probably worse than others, but you still equip them, because they're still good. \
\
It's not just speed, the ability to breathe is very useful. \
Also note that BRD is almost completely underwater, so that's an example of where aquatic form is useful too. \

\
It's like travel form only with water. I use it all the time. I wouldn't be complete without it either.\
\
Blizzard has long said they won't do an underwater instance for quiet awhile until they work out gam mechanics and even if they did Sea lion would have limited usefulness.\
\
However, I use it when gathering water bound herbs, trying to get somewhere faster etc. \
\
Here's some examples:\
\
Going to onyxia? Jump off the boat into the water and swim the whole way, leave your raid in the dust.\
\
ZG, there is a water boss, you have to get under water or when he throws you you will land on land and kill yourself. As a druid you can pop in and out of sea lion to get your breath back. \
\
Farming that big iron fishing pole? nuff said. \
\
I used it when farming, when trying to get somwhere, and other times. I've had people say \"curse druids and their seacowness!\" \
\
There are times when you need to go under water elsewhere, Sunken temple, zg, aq20(there's some fish guys, and if you're trying to outrun buru you might fall in the water) black fathoms depths (several points) feralas, couple of quests in EPL. All over Azuara (not spelled right sorry) and that MC quest guy, you need to locate the final chest under water. Wetlands quests, a couple of Booty Bay quests, escaping the mobs from some booty bay quests... AB BG is also an awesome place to use it...\
\
I don't know how you came to doubt the infinate usefulness of it.\
\
I would rather save money on breathing pots or not bother warlocks and just handle these things myself.\

    "30341876034182006/11/11 02:44:40madroxePart 1:\
\
The local in Moonglade whom you can to speak with is the flight master, Silva Fil'naveth.  She'll tell you to head out to Darkshore for one half of the pendant.  Fly or hearth to Darkshore, then head north up the road near the Cliffspring River.  Once you get near it, start heading north out to the shore, then into the ocean.  Swim out to 48, 11. You'll see a large, gray rock sticking out of the water. But before you go for the seal, you'll probably need to deal with the Elder Threshers first.  Once you eliminate them, swim to the north side of the rock and down to the bottom and retrieve the seal from the chest. Congrats!  You've completed the first half of the quest... \
\
Part 2:\
The next half of the pendant can be found in the Westfall area. To get to Westfall, you have about a 45 minute run ahead of ya., Let me get you headed in the right direction. \
\
In Auberdine, run past the innkeeper onto the pier and run down it until you can make a left or right. Go left to the end of the pier and take the boat to Menethil Harbor.  Once there, run to shore and talk to Shellei Brondir (the gryphon master) to get the flight path. Then go north out of the harbor into the Wetlands, and STAY ON THE ROAD!!! (chances are you aren't of level to be doing stuff here yet, and if you wander off you may find a quick trip to your grave. Lots of hungry crocs around ;)\
Follow the road all the way east and down to the southern part of the Wetlands map until the road takes a last minute turn west which leads to Dun Algaz (54,70).  Go through the tunnel, out onto the road, into another tunnel (repeat like 3 or 4 times).  Just keep on the road. **CAUTION! Be on the lookout for Dragonmaw Grunts and Scouts (orcs). There are a couple who hang out near the road, and chances are good that they will attack.  If you can, get a root off on them and go.**\
As you go through the last tunnel, you'll enter the land of Loch Modan.  Follow the road south until you get to about 32,49 - just outside the town of Thelsamar. Head just SE off the road to a dwarf named Thorgrum Borrelson (gryphon master) to get access to the flight path, which you will be thankful for later on.\
\
Hop back on the road and continue south to about 23,70 where you will probably see a traveling merchant, and take a right on that road.  Follow it and go through the South Gate Pass, which takes you out to the snowy area of Dun Morogh.  Follow the road west all the way down until you get to coords 37,44.  Now make a right and cross the small bridge, then head up the hill to get to Ironforge. Once inside, open up your map and head to the center of it to the Great Forge.  Look for another gryphon master just next to it and speak with him for the flight path here (Gryth Thurden).  Now open up your map again, and head to the area known as Tinker Town, which leads you into the zone portal for the Deeprun Tram.  Take the Tram which takes you to Stormwind.  Open your map again and head to the Trade District, then look for gryphon master Dungar Longdrink.  Speak to him for the flight path then do a 180 and dive off into the water.  Swim past the Valley of Heroes then get to shore and run up and out of the entrance gates into Elwynn Forest.  As SOON as you leave the gates, make an immediate right and follow the Elwynn border all the way SW until you hit the road again, then make a right on the road to enter Westfall.  Go down the road until you see gryphon master Thor off the right side of the road near Sentinel Hill.  Talk to him then head straight west, off of the road, past the mobs onto the shore and into the waters of The Great Sea.  Swim out to 17,32 dive down deep until you see a bubbly fissure.  As you approach it for air, open up the chest and grab the second half of the pendant.  Now it's time to go put it together. Off to Moonglade we go! Teleport!!\
\
Once in Moonglade, run west towards the Shrine of Remulos again.  Hit your Moonglade teleport one more time. [con't]",

\
Time : 20 min\
\
After killing Dalin, I started my swim by Pyrewood Village. Just follow the wall around. You have to stay CLOSE to the shore once you start leaving Silverpine {you will zone in and out of Silverpine a few times}, there is a lot of fatigue zone. Once you make it out of the Dead Zone area into Hillsbrad, make -sure- you are soulstoned.\
\
Here the dead zone opens up. You will have a big island on one side of you and the coast on the other. Swim towards the island {Purgation Isle} but DON'T get too close. These mobs are about level 50 and will beat you down hard. But you do want to get far enough away to avoid the 28ish murlocs and naga all along the coast of Hillsbrad. The murlocs at least swim VERY far from shore. From there you can pretty much safely swim from \"island\" to \"island\" to avoid all mobs {the islands are just big rocks}. There are no real fatigue zones here. At the last island head towards the shore again.\
\
Now you've hit Arathi. Stay towards the shore until about 17, 80. At 17, 80, swim due south to avoid the Naga. Do not go to the shore, there are more 28-30 murlocs. Once you can see the murlocs, it's a Scylla and Charibdys moment. Stay in the middle and you should not agro either. Enter the pass. There are no mobs here. Swim under the Thandol span, on your left, past the bridge is a ramp up. This is the only way out. Be sure you are still soulstoned and your VW is out.\
\
At the top of the ramp is a level 30 bomb throwing dwarf. *sneer* Send in your blueberry, stay on the edge of the cliff and run past onto the bridge. Call off your VW and you should lose agro about halfway over the bridge. Comar will be on your right as you leave the bridge.\
\
I died once due to being far too curious about Purgation Isle :X Never had to sacrifice my VW.",

If you start out on the road at around 44, 45 and follow that north you can pick up the amount of Mana Crystals required for Unstable Mana Crystals and kill the Arcane Patrollers along the way for the Major Malfunction quest. The road will bring you under the bridge and right up too the side door of the house at 45, 38 where Thaelis is located. You will have to kill maybe two Urchins outside, and one inside and then you can pull Thaelis by himself. Turn around and take the same road back the way you came in. \
