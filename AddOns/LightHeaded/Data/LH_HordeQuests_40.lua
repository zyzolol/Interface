With my hunter I noted that it seemed to be related to the killing blow, and did some testing on it (turning pet on passive just before the mob died etc) and then reported it to a game master, who suggested it might be a range problem. At that point I abandoned the quest (I'd completed it but not delivered it) and started over, where I tested if range had something to do with it.\

In melee range + killing blow resulted in 'drop'\
In melee range + pet's killing blow resulted in no 'drop'\

Cosmos Level: 32 \
Creep Level : Ogres are 32-33, Enforcers are 33-34 \
Located at : Ogres are anywhere from 31, 48 to 35, 44, which is North (and a little East) of Stromguard. Enforcers are inside the cave at 35, 44 \
\
Creep XP : About 230 (for a level 32 mage, with normal rest) \
Quest Completion : 2550 XP, and 30 silver. \
Creep Drops : About 1 silver, and 30 copper per ogre. Good farming for tailors, since I had a pretty constant drop of silk and wool \
\
Tips : - When they become enraged, they double their damage (from about 45 per hit, to about 100 per hit), but become much slower. Even a few steps back will buy you a few seconds more. \
- I noticed that they had a fairly decent aggro range, so its best if you cleared the area instead of sneaking by them. \
- Ogres are based along the road, and just North of Strom. The road is used often by both horde and alliance, but I noticed more alliance than horde. Some folks also wait for their group on the road outside Strom, so you might \
get picked off if you're on a pvp server . Its best to try and stay infront of the cave. \
\
- Really good area for Herbologists. Noticed an assortment of plants =) \
\
Finish: \
Cash it at Hammerfall with a guy called 'Drum Fel' on the upperdeck, near the inn, at 74, 33 \
Time: \
Took me about 40 minutes as a 32 mage, but I died twice, and did some pvp fighting. \

I'm only wearing greens, with a puny enhancement spec which is far from optimal at this level, so basically if I can do it, you can too. Don't give up, play to the best of your ability, use the totems you have, and a 23-24 mob won't be able to withstand the shocks that you do manage to get through (I had to kill a lvl 23, lvl 20 to get to the fountain, and a lvl 24 on my way out).

It's a sole tree directly behind the Sepulcher catacomb's entrance, and you'll have to jump a bit to get past it, but as soon as you do the path becomes inescapably clear. Drink the sapta, attack the neutral elemental called Corrupt Minor Manifestation of Water, loot, and apply the quest items to the brazier.\

Don't forget to talk to the Minor Manifestation of Water that appears afterwards though, it's a long run back to get another sapta.\

You only have to harvest crystals from the big crystal formations found throughout the Draeni village called The Fallow Sanctuary.  It's the area in the north-northeast of the zone.  I found that the Draeni character models blend VERY well with the surrounding swamp, so what looks like an easy one-on-one kill can become two-on-one or even three-on-one.  It doesn't help that the mobs are level 37-38.\
\
If you have the patience and want to play it extremely safe, you will usually find one or two crystal formations with only one nearby mob.  Just loot those and wait on a respawn.\
\
Due to the fact that the Draeni blend in, and they tend to run when their health is low, you can end up with some very nasty fights, so it's not a bad idea to bring one or two friends for backup.\
\
You can accomplish much more than this quest in this area, though.  If you are allied with the Gelkis centaur in Desolace, one of their later quests sends you to retrieve a gem from Ongeku, who is found in the northwestern part of the village.  Near him you can find a caged human that starts an escort quest.  Finally there is a rare spawn chieftan that tends to spawn near Ongeku.",

Beware of the Syndicate Highwayman http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=2586.  They are stealthed and have a nasty habit of getting aggro when the current mob your attacking is running for help.  Use any CC you can.  Yes, it is a fairly longer quest.  Grind it out though.  It is worth the experience.\
\
-Warriors- \
Use piercing howl and hamstring (if tauren use war stomp also) to reduce your chances of this happening.  If you aggro 2 mobs use Retaliation and keep them close together so you counter attack both of them.\
\
-Tips & Tricks-\
Work your way into the center of the cow grazing patch and (if solo) single pull to the center.  Guns, Bows, Throwing weps are a must if doing single pulls. General (33,28)  Be aware that aggro is kind of funny and random most of the time.  Try to pull while other mobs around the one you are pulling are looking away in an opposite direction.",

Take the path up the hill and you will find the Manor, while you go thru the Rite of Passage (thru the tunnel) ther will be a box with a message, do not open it unless u wanna fight a 33 level elite guard. Go thru the tunnel and finish your quest... its pretty simple after that. I suggest before you go looking for the Manor, stop by Durnholde Keep and do a bit of pick-pocketing and get yourself like 20-30 Syndicate Emblems, so after u go thru the rites of passage you turn the emblems in at the guards downstairs, and get your reputation up high quickly...

The drop rate on the hearts is fairly low and the raptors have a pretty high aggro range as well as nice long patrol routes.  Throw in some spiders and buzzards, and you have the opportunity to get slammed with adds.\
\
Also, for some reason the area for this particular raptor tends to draw some of the worst players I have ever seen.  Players attempting this area at too low level often draw whole areas of raptors away, which causes trouble if you think you are in a relatively safe spot.  Higher level players (40+...why are they there?) tear through all the mobs very quickly and usually aren't too keen on sharing.",

The Hatefury Satyr can be found in the north east corner of Desolace, and the Lesser Infernal (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=4676) can be found by following the path south, the one that doesn't lead to the graveyard, to Feralas. Also found in that location will be Mana Eaters (needed for the Fragments of the Orb of Orahill quest (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1799) also a Warlock Quest), a few Succubi, as well as a few humanoids. The Lesser Infernal is around level 35-36, so it isn't an easy fight as it is a very tight area.",

If you can't find a demon low enough to enslave (it has to be level 34 or lower at level 32) then you can easily do the warlock \"kiting\" technique and just run while you have your instant DOTs always on. I recommend having your succubus out, also. As she won't try and tank the thing, and just add an extra attack. I killed a level 36 Infernal in about 20 seconds or so.

The absolutely highest mob you should encounter is level 37 infernals, which I suppose is where the red comes from, but they come in both lvl36 and 37, so it shouldn't be a problem to pick off a 36 somewhere. \

Sent voidy in, let it get aggro, dotted it up and just watched my pet's health while keeping dots up. \

I had Scrolls of Stam II and Prot II on me and my vw, a Fire protection pot on me, and about +45 shadow damage. Basically, it kills my vw in a few hits then comes after me. I try to CoX kite it, and that works for a while, but my dots don't dps enough, and it deaggro's, heals, and runs back to it's pat area. I tried banishing it when I got low on health and mana, then Lifetapping and Bandaging (had already used Healthstone), but with the level disparity, Banish failed every other cast, and broke early.  Such an effin pain.\

They are level 38-39, so it is a bit more difficult of a quest when you are level 30-32, but you can get a higher level friend to assist you. The drop rate is around 4-5% not very high but they still drop quite frequently, usually takes 2-8 kills for both of them.\

To get the Fine Gold Thread you have to go talk to your Tailor friend in Booty Bay, the one who you gave the Gold Bar to earlier in the quest. He wont have a question mark or exclamation point on his head, but he still has your Fine Gold Thread if you talk to him.",

Gather enough charms, \"tag\" the mob by doing some damage with a spell (it has to be *your* damage, not your pet's!), then simply right-click the charm to kill the exile immediately.  As long as you tagged it, you can loot it.\
\
Getting the initial \"tag\" is the hard part at level 31 as the resist rate is very high.  I found using my VW to tank as long as possible - then saccing him if needed - was a good way to buy me the time needed to get a few points of spell damage on the Exiles' health bars.",

\
First, carefully watch the patrols outside the villa, particularly the Conjurer who goes inside. When safe, pull the conjurers to the sides of the entrance and the warder at the doorpost, sheeping any adds you get as necessary. Also beware of the  mobs that patrol the road.\
\
Then pull the conjurer patroller and kill her.\
\
Now, you should be able to go inside and pull the mobs in the archmages room. Get away from the room to the left as you go in as soon as possible in case the wandering conjurer respawns, cause she goes in there. If you spot her patrolling again, you can kill her again just to be safe.",

There'll be 3-4 other Dalaran units in there with him (Always seems to be at least one Conjurer with a Voidwalker in there as well, sometimes 2 or 3 of them). Needless to say, it's a pain. If you're a rogue, you can stealth in, kill the archmage quick, and either run out or die. If you can't stealth, you'll probably need a group unless you're at least 22+.",

\
All you need to do is properly pull a target and crowd control any  add-ons. Let's say you use Curse of Agony on a Conjurer, and another Conjurer tags along, have your Voidwalker attack them and use Torment on each at least once, from there you could use Rain of Fire a couple times to finish them off, or take the mobs out one by one.\

It's relatively simple. :) I never want to do this quest again though. Ghostlands is a much better zone for 10-20.",

Next on your right you should see a big corded off room that is set slightly lower than the path and is full of dwarves, this is the room! (if you accidentally miss this and go too far don't worry you will get to a dead end almost straight away) The room is full of various Elites who will aggro each other easily, so if you plan to solo this then plan to fight 2-4 Elites at once :) The tablet is inside that big chest (ark-like thing) in the middle of the room.\

Start by clearing the surrounding area of all mobs so you can psychic scream, without it there is little chance you will survive. Bubble youself and place the banner.

\
1) Buff yourself up (You can use lightning shield, but don't renew it). Plant totems (I chose strength of earth, healing wave and searing to begin with, then used stoneclaw to allow me to focus on one mob at a time).\
\
2) Plant Banner.\
\
3) Bring the two enraged furbolgs to 10/5%, then cut your DPS. You may think \"Oh god! Now I'll die!\" but they can be successfuly kited around the mound using earthbind totem, allowing you to regen mana and use Lesser Healing Wave to top yourself up.\
\
4) After 2/ 2.5 minutes of the banner, the Chief will spawn. Immediately drop the two furbolg and focus on him. While he doesn't hit that hard, you may be low on mana, so check yourself beforehand.\

    "662131197031192006/11/07 17:19:27LasrequestI recently 2-manned this quest as a level 27 fury warrior working with a 28 feral druid.  The druid started off in cat form, but found it was necessary to switch to bear form early on in the fight due to the amount of damage being dealt to us.  He did need to switch to caster form to lay down a few heals during the battle, though if you have a group of 3 or more, healing probably isn't necessary for this fight.\
\
After you place the banner, two Enraged Foulwealds (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=12921) will spawn. If you're on the \"totem mound\" where you placed the banner they'll attack you, otherwise they'll attack the banner and eventually destroy it if not attacked.  After a while (or once the first are dead, I'm not sure), another two will come.  Expect a lot of angry bears and no chance to rest!\
\
Eventually Chief Murgut (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=12918) will spawn who, if you've survived so far, shouldn't give you any problems.  Have fun :)",

\
You have to keep your pet's HoT on, and I ended up using a bandage on him as well whilst letting them beat on the banner a bit.  Have to be careful with your mana too, don't go blowing it all in the first 30 seconds, I was out by the time the last one came, but it didn't matter, he was easy.  Didn't even use a potion.",
    "662117006671687202007/10/16 22:53:52KremonteAlso confirming this; any class with a reappliable CC can solo this, and I'm sure others can too. I just did it solo as a 25 mage (the \"normal\" way, with a 28 rogue, ended in disaster after I ran OOM and his health ran low). I figure some simple strategies would be a nice addition.\
I also noticed while doing this quest that, at the path just out of the area a few paces north there is a log, and if something goes wrong, you can go up the path and jump onto the log pretty easily - this will evade both mobs, and unless you can get back quickly and get them off the banner, it will die... but you won't!\
\
When Murgut spawned, unsure that it was a consequence of the mob being at full health, but one of the two mobs I was fighting despawned.\
\
[b]Mage[/b] - this one's obvious, and it helps (a lot) if you're frost. The two mobs will spawn, sheep one of them, and kite the other. Rank 1 frostbolt is your friend; it slows, and can proc frostbite. Use debuff timers if you have them so you don't waste mana. I recommend bringing at least a lesser mana pot.\
\
[b]Warlock[/b]- this one's obvious too, just abuse fears. Make sure the local area is completely cleared or you're in for some bad news; keep out a voidwalker just in case, for the extra tank and for a sacrifice. I recommend fear juggling using rank 1; try not to spam it too much or you will run oom, but don't aggro extra adds! Alternatively, you can use your VW to tank both of them and just spam health funnel and bandage.\
\
[b]Rogue[/b] - trickier, but doable. I couldn't do this until 28 on my rogue, which lessened the mobs beating up on me (and also saved me on the boss.) Don't pop evasion until the boss spawns; if you can sap at the beginning, do it, and crippling kite the other. If you want, put crippling on both hands, but at least have it on your main hand. My suggestion would be to abuse the log at the top of the path; kite one down, evade it back, run to the totem and restart. You may need to blow sprint on that, but that's fine. With gouge and crippling, you shouldn't need it to escape.\
\
[b]Warrior[/b] - not sure if this is doable; bring a health pot. Try to keep hamstring up on both mobs, and when your health dips below half, use your fear and bandage. Worst case, you can run to the log, evade them, chase them back, charge one of them, then tab -> swing or thunderclap to get them off of the totem. It's not a problem here if you kill them as a side effect of the kiting, just don't drop too much health.\
\
[b]Hunter[/b] - incredibly simple, really. Try to keep one spam trapped, and have your pet on the other. Make sure that your pet has all of its non-growl spells OFF autocast, to keep the mobs alive. It would also help to have your pet have aggro on the trapped mob, so between casts you won't get hit, and you can continue spamming mend pet. Then you can distracting shot -> trap the add, and repeat.\
\
Unfortunately, I'm in doubt that a priest, paladin, or shaman could solo this. A druid might be able to, but it would be very hard, and you wouldn't need a guide if you can pull that off.",

\
Basically throw down a mana spring, then use Stoneclaw whenever it's off CD and there's a new mob spawn. He'll go straight for the totem and let you fight one at a time. I popped a mana pot as soon as I hit 50%, then used the heal pot for the 3 way fight when the boss spawns. Kill slow and fight less mobs.",

\
The only thing I would like to add is you never really mentioned a good tactic of dispatching the Mobs except for AoE them, so here is what I would like to add:\
Since the Mobs are magical, definitely use the recommended buffs as stated, and use Blizzard if you are specced in frost and flame strike if fire specced (obvious I know, but you never know with some people) \
No need to frost nova them in place first before starting Blizzard or FlameStrike, they will move only a little bit but not enough to move out of the AoE radius\

    "19574860930486092007/03/09 07:57:14ReaonIf you're not 40, don't bother trying to do this trick, it's near impossible below 40. Anyway, I tried doing the trick at 40 both fire and frost specced and I have to say, frost is way better than fire in this case. Why? Mainly because Ice Barrier is a lifesaver. Though Blast Wave does some nice damage, it's mainly protection you need for this trick (imo) so Ice Barrier is best.\
\
+dmg gear is better than +int gear here, but +sta is also very usefull. I've got +83dmg atm and my cone of cold crits for 650, which takes away roughly 60/70% of their life.\
\
The best way to do these guys is the way topsub described (flamestrike > immediately blink > frost nova > cone of cold > arcane explosion til dead)\
\
Speed is also very important during these fights, if you slack you WILL die (unless you're lvl 42+ maybe). These guys can use instant shocks and from what I see, it doesnt seem to be on cooldown, cause one time I actually got hit by 2 shocks in a row from one mob (the rest was dead, so I'm sure it was just one mob).\
\
Also, should you be AoE'ing and a new mob spawns while you're killing them, it would be wise to AoE the rest and then run. The best way to run is southwest across the water, since there are practically no mobs there. Just a little hint.\
\
At lvl 40 they give 245 exp each, so 490 rested. If you aoe 1 group of 5 mobs while rested, that's nearly 2500 exp... need I say more? This trick is the best ever, I levelled from 40 to 43 in one day without being rested.\
\
ps. these mobs use either lightning shock, lightning bolt or melee, so there's no point in using wards. Just get a friendly priest to buff you and you'll be fine.",

Always hear about Mage AoEing is the best thing since sliced bread? Never been able to REALLY do it? Now you can! Go to the Dustwallow Marsh to receive this quest, Mana Surges, but be aware you would have to complete the quest to go to Uldaman before you can gain access to Mana Surges. This is a really nifty trick that I have never heard anybody talk about. I just happened to find this out on my own and startd to use it on my mage. With this nifty trick you can gain up to 55,000 xp/hr at level 40-45 easily, and yes, solo. Here's what you do:\
\
1.) Make hundreds of food/drinks.\
\
2.) Accept Mana Surges quest.\
\
3.) Walk outside near the two torches and buff up. (Mage Armor, Dampen Magic, Arcane Intellect, Mana Shield)\
\
3.) DELETE THE QUEST! (This is the most important part.)\
\
4.) The mobs spawn, 2 sets of 2's, 2 sets of 3's, 2 sets of 4's, all the way up to 2 sets of 5's. The mobs will spawn 1-5 seconds after they die. So AS SOON as the mobs die, run away and start resting up for the next set of AoEs.\
\
5.) Your able to AoE these mobs and get as much XP as you possible can, for 10 minutes, then the mobs despawn. After this, go back to step number 2.\
\
Repeat all of the above steps to get some of the best xp in the game.",

A mage is required to START the quest and get the Mana Surges to spawn, but after, the mage can leave while you (any ranged dps class like druids, priests, warlocks) can stay and kill the Mana Surges. As long as they keep dying, the rift that they spawn from will not despawn. Just remember to bring lots of water and some food!\

One note:\
\
I am a frost mage with all +damage gear so my life is kinda low. What i found works best for me was this:\
\
1. Once full of life and mana cast \"Ice barrier\"\
2. Stand middle of the torches and cast a \"flamestrike\"\
3. after cast instantly \"blink\" into them \
4. cast \"frost nova\"\
5. followed by instant \"Coc\"\
6. then AE till dead but at this point  should be just few AE away from death.\
\
Then repeat.\
\
For me after the big 5 groups i had anywere from 200 - 350 life left  but they are dead.\

However, the mobs in the Stonetalon Peak area tend to be higher level, including Corrosive Sap Beasts.\
\
For the twilight whiskers, kill the Twilight Runners. These are only found in Stonetalon Peak, in the northeast part of that area.  Be careful not to run near the Alliance area while hunting Runners.\
\
The courser eyes drop off any courser in Stonetalon Peak, around the lake, or in the valley connecting the two.  Thankfully, the drop rate on eyes is 100% and you get two eyes for every kill.\

The fey dragon scale drops off any fey dragon, all found in the Stonetalon Peak area.  Drop rate is 100% and you only need one.\

Two dangers to be aware of.  First, there is an elite night elf that patrols down from The Den in the west-northwest.  Be alert when fighting those sap beasts and twilight runners.  Second, there is a fey dragon that patrols the perimeter of Stonetalon Peak.  This mob is level 27, making it the highest level creature next to the aforementioned night elf and the guys in the Alliance outpost.  Since this quest is easily done at level 23-24, the level 27 fey dragon can likely kick your butt.  Stay aware.\

As such, the shellfish traps are usually camped hardcore, making it difficult to finish the quest, depending on your server.\

You may have to zone out the first few times because he hits relatively hard. At his smallest point he averages 15 damage (To a 48 Mage).

Just takes some patience",
    "1956163413301634132007/10/05 16:57:22HearthvaderJust completed this today as a moderately geared 36 frost mage. With him being six levels higher than me it was very difficult to hit him even with Elemental Precision (Resist chance -3%) The boss will splinter off and create adds every 20% damage he takes, when he does this his melee damage drops dramatically though. Each splinter seems to drop his damage by about 20% or so down to around 10-40 or so once fully debuffed. The first splinter was the most difficult to pull off as he starts off the fight hitting like a freight train hitting a stalled bus full of orphans, nuns and puppies (about 300-400 on cloth... ouch.)\
\
Like everyone else has said, start off the fight at max range, put up the mana shield and frost / fire ward then nuke him as hard as possible before he can get to you. (May need to run out if first fire/ice-bolt is resisted or reflected.) Once he's down to 80% he'll shard and spawn the add... I had to run out at this point as it took everything I had to just drop him 20% the first time. Then with each set of adds I would blizzard at max range then frost nova, cone of cold, arcane explosion them down and run for the exit again.\
\
This got much easier as the splinter debuffs stacked and even reduced the numbers of attempts taken to splinter him again. Once he was fully debuffed I got to start the long part of wanding him to death. This was remakably easy to do, even at 36, by just keeping mana shield up and wanding him down. He will still spawn his adds every 20%, but they are easy to deal with by just frost novaing, then CoC & Arcane Explosion til dead. I had Gift of the Naaru to heal myself, and for a mage it's pretty much a full heal every 3 minutes, and evocated twice to keep my mana up. \

Then, as said, tank the little guy after all the orignal adds have despawnd using FN to root the new spawns, take them out with AE/BW and CoC.\

To get the Icefury, Ragefire, or Nether Force Wand you must also complete the mage quest chain beginning with Hidden Secrets (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1949). That involves a run to the Scarlet Monastery Library.  \

Thinking he was downstairs, we pulled into the room at the bottom of the stairs, which leads into the upper portion of the dining room. With the right timing you can get 1 or 2 per pull. If he is upstairs then we pulled to the top of the stairs. Its best to clear the room to the left of the capt's room to avoid extra adds when you fight him. Runners can be a major problem up there and will lead to some nice trains if they get away since the space is tight. \

Just a warning for some reason I kept getting aggro from up above in the big room with the steam tanks. There were riflemen up there that kept sniping me then would chase down the strairs bringing about 10 of their friends. If this happens to you id suggest running to the opposite side of the room and dieing at the bottom of the stairs as that spot seemed to be safe to res/buff. Dunno if this was a bug or just the fact that riflemen were up there and i was an orc or what but the undead and troll i was with did not have the problem. Perhaps im just unlucky.\

MOLDY TOME COORDINATES: 44, 37\
\
--Tattered Manuscript--\
You may want to start with this one since its a little closer to where you pick the quest up. The manuscript is being held smack dab in the middle of a murloc camp. The manuscript looks like a little nondescript book just laying in the sand among the other debris of the camp. The manuscript spawns at a random camp so no definite coordinates can be given but the camps are located southwest of the human town of Southshore and start at  46, 68. There are quite a few murlocs so you might want to get some friends to help you slaughter the murlocs and grab the manuscript but this quest is soloable. One tactic that Ive had luck with is running out to the hilly area behind each murloc camp and using the Eye of Kilrogg to scout out the camp. Once Ive located the manuscript, Ill clear the area of any murlocs leading up to the camp, send in the Voidwalker to gather aggro, grab the manuscript then run away, sacrificing the VW if neccesary. This technique can also be used on the ocean side of the camps if you prefer however your escape will be hindered by murlocs and the fact that you will be swimming rather than running.\
\
--Moldy Tome--\
The Moldy Tome is located within the cave Splinterhoof Hold located in Thousand Needles coordinates 44, 37. After entering the cave, branch right as soon as you're able. Follow this path past the waterfall until you see a small chest labeled \"Damaged Chest\". This contains the tome which you seek. The centaurs in the cave are slightly stronger than the ones outside. Centaurs flee when their health is low so keep Curse of Recklessness handy; you don't want a centaur running off and aggroing the whole cave. Also, be wary of the Lightning Cloud that the Stormers cast.",

You will also need to complete “Deep Cover” (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=2458) in order to talk w/ the questgiver. Otherwise, he is ?? red and will attack you. \
\
Location: The tower is right next to the quest giver (55,6). \
\
IF YOU ARE A BLOOD ELF: The next quest in the chain is bugged and the weaknesses described above don’t work and it is impossible to solo until about lvl 25. I just completed this by grouping with another non-Blood Elf rogue. I just did a \"/who 20-21 rogue\" and whispered any non-BE players if they did the poison quest yet. Found an undead rogue who hadn't and invited him to group. Walked him through the steps (as outlined above) and he was able to take them out fine\
\
Instructions above about weaknesses are accurate. I’ll simply summarize quickly.\
\
1- (outside on the left) You need to pickpocket the key from Silixiz. If he doesn't have anything to pickpocket, kill him and wait for him to respawn. He only gives one key per respawn. To be nice to the next guy, I would kill him after you have the key.\
\
2- (First floor): Mutated Drones. Key Ability: Ambush kills them in one shot. You can ambush one, sprint away. Then come back and ambush the other. \
\
3- (Second floor) Patrollers. Key Ability: Rupture takes off extra damage.\
\
4- (Outside - third floor): Lookouts. Key Ability: Eviscerate turns them into weak oozes. A one pointer will transform them into green slimes that are easy to kill.\
\
5- (Top floor) Gallywix. Key Ability: Ambush. It does 50% of his health in damage. Ambush him to lower his life to 50%, then the rest of the fight is as you would expect. You might have to gouge/bandage and pop evasion to finish him, but he is killable at 20. If you wait till 22, you can Ambush then vanish and Ambush again. After he's dead, take his head and lockpick the chest (need skill ~85 I think) and you're done. \
\
IF GROUPED: When you group w/ someone else who has this quest, you have to each pickpocket the key off Silixiz and each loot the dead body of Gallywix for the head. This means that you have to:\
a) pickpocket the key\
b) kill Silixiz and wait for the respawn\
c) pickpocket the key again for the 2nd player (repeat for next guy)\
e) after killing Gallywix only have 1 of you loot the body and chest (you'll need to wait for respawn and kill him again and whoever loots will get the poison debuff)\
\
DONT LOOT THE CHEST UNTIL YOU HAVE THE HEAD.  You will get a 7 day debuff that lowers agility and makes it easier to detect you in stealth.  If you have to come back for Gallywix with the debuff, you are going to get spotted pretty easily when you try to amush.",
    "2478128945211235292007/07/30 00:21:34fbg111You can still use daggers even when you're Combat, just use a weapon switcher macro:\
\
/equipslot [equipped:Sword] 16 [Exact Name of Dagger to switch to, must be in your bags]\
/equipslot [equipped:Dagger] 16 [Exact Name of Sword to switch to, must be in your bags]\
\
Also works with maces, just replace 'equipped:Sword' with 'equipped:Mace'. That macro switches b/t dagger and sword, even in the middle of combat, instantly.\
\
More very useful Rogue macro's here:\
http://www.wowwiki.com/Useful_macros/Rogue\
\
I also strongly recommend downloading the addon Spellbinder, since it lets you bypass the action bars and bind abilities and macros directly to any key or key combination you want. That way you can Spellbind all your combat abilities and macros to keys around your home keys (in my case ESDF), and put clickable, less combat-crucial abilities on your action bar:\
\
http://wow.curse.com/downloads/details/4960/\
\
Using Spellbinder and Switcher macros lets you very easily spec Combat Swords or Maces, yet still be able to use Daggers for Ambush, Backstab, etc. Very useful for difficult quests like this where you need every ability and edge you can get.",

\
Second floor, again no reaction, walked up to mob and it said I was too far away to attack.  no matter what i did, couldnt touch him.  Tried to walk away and up the stairs, and suddenly my autoattack hit something and he turned to beat on me, from across the room.  I still couldnt hit him but he was beating me down, and as I ran downstairs to escape the newly respawned mobs downstairs  chased me out and killed me.\

After this, everything went as normal.  A note though, the poison doenst just lower your stealth, it triggers an event that makes the foreman outside attack you automatically within a certain range.  Even behind him the event makes him turn around so eh sees you.  Make sure yer done with the stealth part of the quest before picking the lock.

\
Some notes of my own to add to the above post:\
\
- Part 1, Pickpocketing\
Make sure to approach Silixiz from behind and use pickpocket as far away as possible (5 yd range), otherwise he's sure to detect you. Kill him afterwards, both as a courtesy to the next rogue coming to do the quest and in order to avoid him aggro'ing on you in case you have to run away during the rest of the quest.\
\
- Part 2, Mutated Drones\
This seems to be the hardest part. Be very careful and only approach one of them when they turn their backs to you and spam ambush till it connects (their stealth detection is insanely high). Then run till you drop aggro and do the same with the other one.\
\
- Part 3, Patrolers\
These mobs are weak to rupture, but they're very easy to kill even without it. Probably the easiest part, just good ol' hack n slash works on these guys.\
\
- Part 4, Lookouts\
Nothing else to say about them really... just get that 1 CP as fast as possible and immediately Eviscerate. Very easy to kill that way.\
\
- Part 5, Gallywix\
Make sure to have Evasion and healing potions ready and not cooling down before engaging. Open with Ambush to drop him to 50% health, then immediately pop Evasion (he hits very hard, you don't want to waste a moment without it up) and just hack away. Pop a healing potion if necessary. If you're close to dying, make sure he's facing away from the stairway entrance. Didn't try this myself, but supposedly if you die with him facing the stairs, he'll stay in that position when he resets making it nearly impossible to ambush him without being detected.\
\
Another note: \
You do ABSOLUTELY want to use Ambush in the parts that recommend it and you need a dagger in your main hand for that. If you've been using two swords up to this point, get a dagger for this quest. Even if it's a level 1 grey one, doesn't matter, you can just switch to your usual weapon right after you Ambush. Also, be sure to get your dagger skill up to a decent level, you don't want your Ambush to miss.",

As far as I can tell, he spawns either south of Camp Taco, or to the south-east on the other side of the road.\

He isn't \"rare\" in the sense of dropping green loot, he has no special abilities I've seen besides shooting lizard bolt and he seems to be on a one hour respawn, or thereabouts.

The thing with this quest is, for the most part its not hard at all, the mobs are very easy to kill if you only have to fight 2 at a time, the problem comes when they \"spawn\" to attack you. As far as i can tell they spawn 2 at a time and at the end they spawn 3 at time. Now the problem arises when your already fighting the furblogs that patrol the area, so i was overwhelmed by 4 of them, they also flee before they are about to die so you will need to kill them quick.\

\
As the previous comments have stated, if you intend to do this quest solo, it's all but necessary to clear the path between Ruul and the hub that splits into upper and lower paths before his room. This includes the far side of the hub (near the entrance), as those mobs are liable to add during the fight if there's an unlucky runner or Ruul gets positioned badly. Remember to get the caster furblog who paths alongside the upper ramp, as he can easily add during the scripted fights if not dealt with.\
\
The first pack, which appears going down the upper path of the hub and will normally intercept Ruul in the hub, consists of an Avenger, Pathfinder, and Shaman. This pack is the most tricky of the entire quest. A few things to keep in mind:\
\
- Ruul can take a single furblog at a time without taking too much damage, but the furblog will eventually flee and may draw adds. So don't take your eyes off Ruul just because the given fight won't kill him.\

- This pack cannot be avoided by trying to stall Ruul and having them despawn before they enter combat. This pack will not despawn within a reasonable timeframe, but will rather travel to the far end of the room and simply sit there, likely on top of other mobs if the room wasn't fully cleared. This will pretty much guarantee a failed quest, and there's really no profit in trying to do so.\
\
- Let Ruul aggro the pack. No matter what. He has terrible, terrible AI and will simply walk past you if you engage the pack first, leaving you to fend with 3 mobs while he goes and fights (and possibly dies) to whatever lies ahead. If you can take these mobs out all at once, I guess that's okay, but it's not easy.\
\
- Whatever your strategy is, take the Avenger down in these packs first. Yes, the Shaman will probably get a heal off, but this is a small price to pay in order to avoid enraging him by killing another mob. He easily does half the DPS of the entire group.\
\
Hopefully these tips help you get past the first pack. After that, things are relatively easy, but still not a cakewalk. Ruul will path through the furblog camp and draw adds... often several at once, which can be quite dangerous. It's advisable to clear ahead of him if you aren't near the end where the second pack of furblogs spawns. If not, remember... whatever you aggro, Ruul is liable to ignore and just keep going past. Don't get in a fight with a mob on the side while Ruul aggros 3.\
\
At the end (past one of the gates, I forget exactly where), you have to deal with another 3-pack. Thankfully, the risk of adds is much lower this time, making the fight more managable. Beat them and you're pretty much in the clear.\
\
Good luck.",

However, getting to Tabetha is a PITA at this level because of all the 39 to 41 level mobs that are in the area.  If you do want to try this quest at a lower level here's the steps that worked for me.\
\
1. Use Voidwalker\
2. As soon as the Felguard is summoned, have the VW tank for a pretty good period of time.  DoT the Felguard.  When the DoT's finally overpower the VW's ability to tank (he can't hold aggro) then fear the Felguard and tell the VW to stay (so you don't pull more enemies.  The Felguard won't pull enemies when he's feared).\
3. Use the VW's Sacrifice when you are getting low on life or need a break from getting hit.\
4. Keep using a combination of Fear + DoT's, Drain Life and the occasional Shadowbolt or Searing Pain whenever you can.\
\
I used one healthstone and two potions in this fight (two health).\
Also, I am affliction spec.  The Shadow Trance helps a lot as long as you keep Corruption and Drain Life on the Felguard.",

\
Most of the nagas are underwater, the drop rate of the oracle crystal is low, the spawn of the oracles is shared with that of all other slitherblades, and, should you die, the corpse run is longer than you'd expect.\
\
However, if you are really intent on completing it, here's what you should do.\
\
First, know that to get oracles to spawn, you must kill other nagas. Fighting underwater, even if you have water breathing, is not a good idea: all the nagas run away when wounded and they swim faster than you.\
\
You should fight on the two islands I tagged here:\

\
Clear one, swim to the other, clear it. Go back and forth like this and you'll eventually get the item.\

He is...doing something (channelling?) at an altar in the middle of a large room.  You can fight around him, just don't get too close or he will 'wake up'.  Be sure to clear all the Twilight Hammer mobs from the room before you start.\
\
Kelris is not that hard by himself.  His only real trick is to cast Sleep.  If you are doing this instance under-manned, that might cause problems.\
\
Rumor has it that if you attempt to fight Kelris without first getting the Blessing of Blackfathom (from the Murloc altar earlier in the instance), he has the ability to mind control your character, thus making them activate the flames around his altar, which in turn summons waves of enemies.  I have not yet fought Kelris without the Blessing, however, so I can't confirm.\
\
Once you beat Kelris, you can activate the flames at the four corners of the altar to open the way to the final area.  Each flame will summon monsters, so use one flame then clear out the enemies it summons.  Use the next flame and so on.  Don't use all four flames in quick succession or you'll be swarmed.\

Along with the essence of exile, you need 30 tusks from the bloodscalp Trolls in STV, and 8 liferoot you can get from the AH or a herbalist. Once you finsih this up though, you will have to fight a elite wind elemental who can be a pretty big pain, but i got it done at lvl 40 (im pretty sure) with a lvl 35 shammy healing me. \
Word on the street is that the most popular weapon to get for this, and some people say its the best one, is the Whirlwind Axe (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=6975#z0z) Along with the Axe, you can also get the Whirlwind Mace (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=6976) and the Whirlwind Sword. (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=6977)\

\
For those with coordinates:\
Rock Elementals can be found at 13,36, near Kargath up some hills by the Graveyard.\
\
The Buzzards can be found at 15,60 around a giant carcass.\
\
And as for the Coyotes...jthey're everywhere across the Badlands, sorry I can't get you any exact spring of surplus coordinates, but they're scattered everywhere. You'll find some if you make a 360 degree turn though, i bet :).\
\
Extra Fact: Here's another fun fact I thought you should know:  The Coyotes drop the tails for the Darkmoon Faire as well, if you need them.",

Had to pull the guys out & have the pirates fight them- even just the hits they got in while running down to the pirates almost killed me. Only the blackwater deckhands will aggro, so its a bit of a run while they're both trying to frost nova you. \
The prof won't die fighting one of them for a few min, but he will if you let him fight both. Learned this after dying twice trying to get both of them at once(for some reason they really like fighting the prof!). Instead I used fire blast on one of them, blinked down to the blackwater raiders, and ran back up and did the same thing with the other one. Once I figured that out wasn't nearly so difficult.\

Around 40,24 there is a nice cluster of 3-4 of their \"camps\" which, as previously mentioned, consist of crates, lamps, etc.  You can usually find one or two of the mobs within close proximity of the camps, and since there are 3-4 within sight of each other at this location, it can be a good place to get this done.

    "1201122691301226912007/07/18 09:05:17ChazusI just did this quest today, and i find it very similiar to the horde quest in Ashenvale, where you hunt the \"Ashenvale Outrunners\".\
\
It's not hard, the mobs spawn all around Brackenwall Village, but i hunted them mostly in the northern end. I usually don't play with sound on, but on this quest i turned it on in order to hear the stealth sound of the mobs. \
\
NOTE: The mobs are stealthed around at random positions, they're not in a camp or something like that, which humanoids tend to be. Very much like the ones in Ashenvale, i mentioned before.\
\
If you're a class with beneficials towards stealthed mobs, use the abilities in order to detect these mobs.\
\
It took me like 10 minutes to do the quest, and it gives some nice xp, so in my oppinion its definately worth doing.\
\
Tips:\
- Turn on your sound in order to detect the stealthed spies. There's other mobs in the area that makes stealth sounds, the lurker-spiders. Avoid those.\
- Use whatever you got to detect the spies. For hunters it could be \"track hidden\", warlocks should use \"Detect invisibility\" etc. etc.\
- Avoid the other creatures as much as possible. They're annoying and you should be able to get your quest targets killed without too much hassle and without wasting to much time.\

Have fun doing the quest.",

Sound or not, they were failry easy to find.  Usually if I found one spy, there were two other spies fairly near. \

Looking closely you could see the spies stalking about ~ this helped with pickpocketing. I was able to snag a few boxes to practice on and some trash cash items to vend.\

North, if you are the right level you mostly need to worry about the wandering group of four guards.  South you can't run through the zone without aggroing stuff and if you stop to fight, three more mobs will add.\

this is a tough zone even if you are level appropriate.  Not sure when I will be able to do this quest. We could get no where near to the NPC and it was late and we were tired. L40s were able to walk around the zone freely, it seemed - or maybe they were just able to kill faster.",

\
Clear the 2 Keepers outside of the area with the key and rare elite Na'taszar, then kill the 3rd Keeper outside that is a patrol. Now, you may have to suicide once or twice to kill off the 2 Keepers inside the area with the rare elite. I killed one, died.. ran back.. killed the second, died, ran back. When you're doing this, you may die too fast from the elite's spells before a Keeper dies, to ensure one dies at least you must somehow LoS or interupt the elite's casts while burning one down. I used HoJ and then Arcane Torrent on the next cast while burning a Keeper. \
\
Another option is to pull one Keeper out and keep hitting him to keep him aggro'd to you until the rare elite and other keeper deaggro, then finish the Keeper off. Repeat for other Keeper then handle the rare-elite.\
\
Now for the elite, simply just LoS all of his casts and he's a joke. At 30% I just HoJ'd the next cast then Arcane Torrented the next and he fell. [b]The key is to LoS his casts because they simply just hit too hard for this level[/b].",

\
The Gatekeeper Key is the first key you should get. It's RIGHT outside the entrance, in a thing that looks like a lamp.\
\
For the claw key, proceed in the cave, down the winding path, and over a bridge. There should be a Birdbath thing right on that center platform with 2 druids on it. That contains the Claw key.\
\
For the Remaining key, The sleeper's key, You proceed through the cave, WAY in the back (When i say back, look at your minimap, and head NW. There's a Bird bath in there as well as 2 gatekeepers, and sometimes (I think, ive always seen him in there) theres a Rarespawn with them. The bird bath contains the key.\
\
Now where to turn them in...I've looked forever for this due to lack of information. Theres 4 Circular big rooms (3 if you dont want to include the small one that is more of a sideways oval). The circular room next to where you got the Sleeper key (which is on the end, so its obvious which room im talking about.) Its in there, on the north side of it.  A hint that ur in the right room, there's a broken bridge in that room.\
\
For Coord mod users:\
\
Gatekeeper's key is outside in a lamp: 29,15 \
Claw key is across first bridge: 29,15 \
Barrow key is in the room with two bridges: 27,13 \
Sleeper key is in the far north west corner: 25,11 \
Hoard / turn in is in the north middle around 27,11\

As a frost mage, when you get to the turn in Hoard, there's 3 dryads surrounding the Hoard. So, what I did was first frost nova, then sheep one so that two would be there.

2- Head north towards the Alterac Mountains, in between The Headland and Corrahn's Dagger. Careful for the Alliance entrance to AV, as the guards will Kill on Sight.\
\
3- Continue north, where you should look for the Growless Cave.  Kill mountain lions until you loot a [Fresh Carcass], then proceed to the Flame of Uzel, (37, 66).\
\
4- Clear the nearby Yetis in and around the cave, click the flames so you get credit for your other quest, then place the carcass on the Flame of Uzel.\

Failed the first time, got him down to 122 health, but my voidwalker was almost dead so Sacrificed him for the bubble figuring I could easily finish off Frostmaw without him. But instead of aggro'ing me, Frost dropped aggro, evaded, healed, ran back to the cave entrance and despawned. I was pissed.\
\
Second try, I didn't kite him so far away from the cave entrance and didn't sac void, and he went down.  If you pull any adds, don't attack them, just run as far away as you can from their pat area, they have a shorter aggro range than Frostmaw and will deaggro and return, then pull Frostmaw back toward the cave so he doesn't evade too.\

Fortunately, not-so-bright players tend to farm these elementals for their drops (I say not-so-bright because it's almost always better to farm something else)( Moderator - Xp is good there, hence people farm em.). Warriors also have a quest to take out elementals, so if you do this at your server's peak time, there is a good chance you can just walk up to each stone and get the appropriate key.\

    "552204630111394252007/12/20 18:21:03BladescopeMister6002, that's technically right and technically wrong.\
\
Every time you kill something which has a chance of dropping it, the static drop chance doesn't increase, no. But the overall -probability- chance of you getting it to drop does.\
e.g. 1% chance to drop gives it a 99% chance to not drop.\
\
Killing once gives\
0.99 = 0.99 (99%) (1% chance to drop)\
Killing one another time gives\
0.99 x 0.99 = 0.9801 (98%) (2% chance to drop)\
Killing one another time gives\
0.99 x 0.99 x 0.99 = 0.970299 (97%) (3% chance to drop)\
\
And so forth. Just remember that those aren't the actual drop chances for the rod, nor are these static in-built values. Probability in itself though is really helpful.\
\
Here's a small fun fact. For a predicted 0% chance for it to not drop, you have to kill 500 of them.\
0.99^500 = 0.00657048304 (0.6 % chance for it to not drop)\
\
Also, because probability is -never- a  guarentee, you will never hit a total 100% chance for this item to probably drop. Closest I can get without going into more complicated math is\
0.99^916 = 0.00010042417 (0.001%) After killing 916 yetis, assuming it has a 1% drop chance.\
\
The reason why static-drop chances never change in a bit more detail is this.\
1 % drop chance, for example\
Killing 1 mob gives you a 1/100 chance of it dropping\
Killing 1 mob after that with the same drop chance gives you:\
2/200 chance of it dropping\
2/200 = 1/100 = 1%\
Killing another 50 mobs after that, 50/5000 = 1/100 = 1%",

The most difficult part were the mobs at the Growless Cave. The first yeti was level 33, so I was able to take him down fairly easily. There are two mobs next to the flame. I sent my pet in on one, and body pulled the other, trapping him. I then immediately charged the rod, and skiddadled out of there while my pet held them. The same tactic should work for a warlock/voidwalker.\
\
Other than that, the other two flames are easy as pie. When going to the cemetary, I had Track Humanoids up, and it couldn't have been easier. I kept my pet out just in case, but the guard didn't aggro on me.",

Be prepared for mobs to run away from you at low health and you're stunned and helpless to stop them from getting friends. \
\
Also to note while stunned, you cannot dodge/miss/parry/block so your health goes down a lot faster especially if you have multiple mobs on you.  \

It is stated that you need an Infernal Orb, but you don't get the orb from and Infernal you get it from the warlocks, Burning Blade Summoner's (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=4668). The drop rate is about 55%, I got it on my second kill because I am an unlucky person. Also, after you get this quest, she tells you to talk to her Acolytes behind her. They give you two options either \"Shard of a Felhound\" (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4962) or \"Shard of an Infernal\" (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4963). \
\
If you go the route of the Felhound you get to choose from a Shadow damage staff, or a Shadow damage Orb. Otherwise, the route of the Infernal gives you a Fire damage Staff, or a Fire damage Orb.\
\
But first, you need to cleanse the orb, and you don't want to turn anything in before hand because you will fail the quest forever (unless they fixed that finally). To do that you have to head to Dustwallow Marsh to find Tabetha (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=6546), ** Remember her location, she is used for future quests**. Tabetha will have you fight a level 40 Elite Felguard, which is possible at level 36 if you constantly fear it while putting Damage over Time spells on him, and have your Void Walker out.",

2. Tabetha - Dustwallow Marsh [46.06, 57.09] / [46, 57]\
\
You will need to choose between Infernal and Felhound, this will determine your reward. Infernal is +Fire Dmg and Hound is +Shadow Dmg.\
\
Once you have decided, head to Mannoroc Coven (1.) and slay Burning Blade Summoners for the Infernal orb. Once done find either the Mana Eater or Infernal and use the item to Capture the soul just like Soulshards. Now head to Dustwollow Marsh (2.) and Speak with Tabetha. You will now have a TIMED quest to cleanse the stone eby killing the demon residing inside. It is Lv40 Elite but very low Def and Resistance. Upon killing the demon speak with her again, timed remember. The next portion is too return the cleansed orb too Menera Voidrenderer in Ratchet (Still north of the Flight Master).\

Go over the hills to the right of the entrance to avoid some of the mobs along the way (watch out for the lvl40 necromancer patrolling). The spot your aiming for is 65, 90. It's a hill up on the left as you make your way in. It's quite close to the Goliaths and well away from all the mobs (its also a very handy spot to run to if your dying; stops you getting ganked when you re-spawn). From this spot you should see the Goliaths and a small mound in the middle (possibly with some tin on it). It's anywhere near this mound that you should run and place your ghost magnet on. Run back to the hill and take your pick of the Magram ghosts walking past. By doing it like this you'll have the quest done in no time but always keep an eye out for ravagers re-spawning and that necromancer. Im a lvl 38 druid and gave up on this quest before, if I hadn't found this spot I never could have got it done. Never give up, never surrender!!",

\
\"+Damage is superior to stats at all levels, especially while leveling. Increasing your mana pool only extends the amount of downtime, and the increase to crit is negligible; the exception is Imp. Drain Soul, and in this case, mana pool only needs to be large enough to make the talent worthwhile. You only need enough stamina to take a few hits, and alternatively, spell damage is a great way to boost survivability because Drain Life, Siphon Life, and Life Tap all scale with +damage.\

I'm level 31 now, with 65 spell damage. No downtime, and I kill mobs very quickly.\"\

My own Warlock is personally at 120 +shadow dam at 32 (some twinking done with a 70 main) and stuff just dies. There is no subsitute for +spell damage, because it is the only thing that shortens your time in combat, hence shortening the time you use your resource pool (health and mana).",

While doing that quest chain you will run into all of the people you have to kill, making this quest free bonus loot and xp rather than a time-consuming assassination quest.\
\
For those without coords:\
\
Farmer Kalaba is found in the field with the peasants in the south part of Hillsbrad Fields. You'll will normally kill her a couple of times while doing part two of the Battle of Hillsbrad quest chain.\
\
Citizen Wilkes patrols most of the Hillsbrad Fields area, but is mostly found near the town hall. You will most likely run into him multiple times while doing the Battle of Hillsbrad quests, so don't bother looking for him unless you're up to the Azurelode Mine part without having killed him.\
\
Clerk Horrace Whitesteed is found inside the main room of the town hall. You can't really avoid killing him while doing the town hall part of the Battle of Hillsbrad quest chain. He's standing along the eastern wall of the biggest room, and because of how close he is to the entrance he will most likely find you before you find him ;)\
\
Miner Hackett is the trickiest one to find, and is the only one you're likely to end up actually having to look for. He spawns at one of numerous locations inside Azurelode Mine, so just look around for him. Your best bet is to hope that you find him while doing the Azurelode part of Battle of Hillsbrad, and to go looking for him after you've killed Foreman Bonds if you haven't found him by then.",

If you do aggro, remember that Infernos are immune to fire, killing them with frost bolts was painful since it doesn't do as much damage. But the fire ward is really helpful, I didn't really take that much damage from them with the fire ward/mana shield combo, just took longer to kill them than I would have liked.",

The best idea i can give you is to have the person(s) helping you clear the way to the objective with you out of party as much as possible.. making sure not to attack, this means taking off a shield that may do damage to an opponent so that you do not gain exp for someone accidently attaking you, when in the instance.. remain outside as to not get unnecessary experiece, the book you need is on a table.. it requires no fighting on your part.. you may even be able to ask a group who is in SM to simply let you retain the group so that you can loot the book.. this may be a \"more practicle\" solution if you do not have the resources availible to get a runner.\

Common bugs are Duriel Moonfire and her escort not appearing after the outpost has been cleared and also Torek's escort not respawning after a failed attempt (though that is not really quest breaking).\

\
The problem can be seen in your quest log. After accepting the quest (and Belnistrasz BOOKS it so fast you barely have time to chase after him), check your quest log. Mine said \"Protect Belnistrasz while he performs the ritual to shut down the idol\" TWICE in the quest log.\
\
If you see this message TWICE in the quest log, that means there is going to be a MASSIVE spawn of DOUBLE mobs. Even with this quest being green to me, I still wiped. Just sit there if you die and don't release - the mobs don't attack Belnistrasz at all and you will get a (Completed) even while you're dead.\
\
Release, make the long corpse run back, and re-clear all the way back to the wipe location. You can then clear out the mobs single pull at a time and complete the quest by clicking the brazier.\

Best of luck! Hope the quest doesn't bug out for you like it did for me!",
    "352514665170146652006/12/13 06:09:48kreghxhave done this myself, so I can say with 100% confidence that this quest CAN be done by all of the people in your party at once. \
\
The setup for this quest is just plain dumb, and desperately needs to be reworked. Basically the way this quest works is you have to talk to Belnistrasz a couple of times (at least twice), and he eventually will offer you the quest Extinguishing the Idol, when you accept this final quest from him, the escort process begins. At this point, everyone in your party that talked to Belnistrasz up until the point where he was offering them the chance to accept the Extinguishing the Idol quest (but have not actually accepted the quest) will be given the typical \"X has started an escort quest would you like to join? Yes or No\" option. Anyone who has not, will not get credit for the quest. \
\
What typically happens when playing through RFD is that someone in your party will click through all of the dialogue boxes with Belnistraz before anyone else has had a chance to talk with him, the quest will begin, and they will be the only one to earn credit for it. If this happens, just let that party member go and try to complete it on their own. That sounds completely fair to me. \
\
Make sure that before you get to this part of the dungeon you warn your party about what is going to happen in regards to accepting this quest. Then have each member talk to Belnistrasz, and ask them \"Does it say Extinguishing the Idol\" at the top of the quest description. If the answer is no, then tell them to select \"accept\" or \"continue\". If the answer is yes, then tell them to hit \"decline\" and wait for everyone else to go through this process. Once everyone in your party can talk to Belnistrasz and have \"Extinguishing the Idol\" pop up, accept the quest.",

This item has a very low drop rate (around 1,5-2%) and is dropped by all Burning Blade mobs around Thunder Axe Fortress (~54,26, upper middle part of the map) in Desolace.\
There is no prequest and you do not need to be on any specific quest for the item to drop.\
The quest is combinable with:\
- [38] Hand of Iruxos, http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=5381 (kill a summoned 37 Elite)\
- [33] Sceptre of Light, http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=5741 (get an item from a Seer in a tower)\
- [33] The Burning of Spirits (followup), http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1435 (drain souls of any Burning Blade)\
\
The quest has three followups. The two first ones are easy. The last one, [40] The Corrupter (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1488), requires you to kill a 40 Elite and a normal 40 mob.",

Once I just got overwhelmed by mobs, the second and third times I failed to aggro a mob that killed Piznik.  Upon first approaching Piznik you'll have to kill 5-6 mobs (watch out, they tend to stack on each other, so what first looked like four mobs to me was actually six) just to get the quest.  Also as a previous poster mentioned, Piznik has very low health - he can be killed by a single mob, and rather quickly if you're chasing a fleeing mob up the tunnel; you HAVE to aggro all the mobs that spawn.  The first wave is pretty easy, only three, but the next wave had five, and then a couple additional adds respawned in the hallway I originally cleared to get to the quest giver.  What finally worked for me was waiting at the slight bend in the tunnel where the waves spawn, quickly sapping one, tagging each of the other spawns to keep them on me, and killing the geomancers first.  Made a quick target macro for them as they can get lost in the crowd.  Crippling poison recommended to deal with runners when you're frostbolted.",

When this wave spawned I was regenerating hp and mana, and so when the kobolds reached me Piznik started attacking them.

\
Mob: Affray Challenger (hostile)\
Level: 26-27\
Health: 860\
\
They come one after the other with a 15-20 second break between. You kill them one by one, if too many Demoralize Shout to fear them all, and hunt them one by one. When you have killed the 5 (?) challenger, the boss comes.\
\
Boss: Big Will (neutral)\
Level: 33\
Health: 1300\
\
You might want to get full health points before going further, you got time to bandage or eat. He is easy, put a rend, demo-shout, use retaliation (if you are desperate) and he is down. Does not hit that hard either, around ~40 and crits ~70 (with demo-shout on).\

Okay, so you've got your 3 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=3575]Iron Bars[/url], 2 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=2841]Bronze Bars[/url], 1 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=3577]Gold Bar[/url], 4 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=4234]Heavy Leathers[/url], 1 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=2319]Medium Leather[/url], and 1 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=2592]Wool Cloth[/url].  Give all this stuff to an Engineer you can trust who has a skill level of at least 185.  You might want to look for a gnomish engineer since they have to make a couple of these to complete their specialization.  That way you'll be reasonably sure they've learned all the relevant plans and have at least a vague recollection of how to construct one.  You might even look for a twink, since they tend to be pretty serious about Engineering.  However, any Engineer with at least 185 in skill has the potential to make one since these are all trainer recipes.  \
\
With these ingredients, the engineer will first turn the Gold Bar into three [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=10558]Gold Power Cores[/url].  Only one of those cores is needed, but don't sweat the extras.  Let your pet engineer make a few silvers off them.  It's the least you can do.  \
\
He'll then combine the power core he's just made with one of the Iron Bars to make a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=4389]Geochronatom[/url].  He'll take the other two Iron Bars and turn them into an  [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=4387]Iron Strut[/url].  Finally, he'll take the two Bronze Bars, the Medium Leather, and the wool cloth and turn them into a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=4382]Bronze Framework[/url].  \
\
With all of his ingredients at hand, he'll take the four Heavy Leathers and combine them with the Geochronatom, Iron Strut, and Bronze Framework to make, ta da, an [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=4392]Advanced Target Dummy[/url].  \
\
He'll give you the dummy, you'll take it to Warug, and he'll break it.",

    "10141421680142162006/12/12 13:51:18kreghxThere is an easy way to kill Arugal. Tag him and run back to the main chamber, where you killed Fenrus. The person who has aggro stays in the Fenrus room. Everyone else goes to Arugal's room. What will happen is Arugal charges towards the Fenrus room and then whacks one or two times (at most, sometimes none at all) and teleports back to his main room. This allows the other members of the group to smack Arugal around until his aggro changes to someone else. This new person can then go to Fenrus' room and repeat as before. Everytime he teleports, he'll erase any dots on him, but he will not reset his health (as of 4/3/06). This most likely will be patched, however. \
\
A few other tips. Do not go into the room to kill Fenrus. Kill him in the hallway. Have the tank stand in the hallway to attract the mobs that spawn afterwards. If you kill a named, sometimes a new wolf-man spawns in a place that you may have cleared. For example, when you kill the Baron, a wearwolf spawns in the room adjacent to the courtyard and adjacent to the Baron's room. This can complicate pulling, so go back and kill this. The tricky pull spot is the Knight's room (up the stairs past the Baron's room). Here is a way to pull this room. Have a warlock cast Eye of Kelrog and have a priest cast the spell-shield on it. The eye can get aggro, but the mobs ignore it unless it gets too close. As a result, you can pull fewer mobs and sometimes even singles from clusters of mobs. (This works in general.) In the Knight's room, have the tank grab the ghost in the hallway. Then send the eye all the way to the right (upon entering) and grab the attention of the Knight's in the back (the side opposite of the named mob). You can clear the room in this way so that when you pull the named you only get 2 adds. Of course, you can also just send in the puller. \

 the alliance version of this weapon is as such:\
\
Verigan's Fist\
http://www.wowhead.com/?item=6953\
Binds when picked up\
Two-Hand Mace\
65 - 99 Damage Speed 3.20\
(25.6 damage per second)\
+7 Stamina\
+6 Intellect\
+12 Spirit\
Durability 100 / 100\
Classes: Paladin\
\
Allthough the stats on our polarm are better for a ret paladin then that of Verigan's Fist, which is what the majority of people would spec to level, there is a 6.9 DPS difference between the Horde and Alliance version, mind you that they both require the same questline. At level 20, that seemingly small difference is in reality a huge amount.\
\
Playing both an Alliance and Horde paladin, the Alliance's mace is amazing for its level, with above average crits for a mid 20 character. This one is really only SLIGHTLY better then the Sin'dorei Warblade from Ghostlands. \
( http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22995 )\
\
The stats are fine, at most this could at least use a small DPS boost, especially considering we have to pay up a gold to learn the polearm skill, and alliance paladins start with a 2h mace skill, not to mention that we are doing the same amount of work for a worse item.",

    "5062194870201948702007/12/02 12:12:22GoilveigL2This quest sucks as a frost mage.  As in, every talent point you have is basically useless, and the traditional frost mage methods of snare and kite are impossible as this is immune to frost.  However, after several tries, I came up with a strategy that works well to solo this, even as a 0/0/x pure frost mage (for all the good those talents do you here, you might as well be 0/0/0...).\
\
This is of course just my opinion, but this worked very well for me and I completed the quest with little difficulty after adopting these methods:\
\
1. First, you must use Dampen Magic.  It reduces all damage dealt by the elementals.\
\
2. Second, before you pull, cast Fire Ward on yourself.  This will absorb the damage, and Dampen Magic's effect will cause this to last longer.  If you want to be extra safe, you can cast this 15 seconds before the pull, so the 30 second cooldown will be up at about the time your ward collapses.\
\
3. When you fight the elemental, make sure you're facing a direction that's clear.  The reason being, you can and should Blink out of its stun, but as you're stunned, you can't change direction.  Make sure you're facing a good direction to Blink into.  Don't burn Blink before it stuns.\
\
4. Always pull with Fireball (or pyroblast if you have it).  After this, you're using Arcane Missiles or Arcane Explosion only -- it's fire resist is high enough that you don't want to cast fire spells, at the same time, being as you can cast fireball/pyroblast before it aggros you, it just acts as a little bonus opening damage.  Always open at max range to get as much DPS in before it reaches you.\
\
5. Don't try to use Mana Shield, it really doesn't work very well; these things hit hard enough that you'll deplete your mana pool very rapidly.",

If you follow the ramp down to the excavation as you would have done for the first stage in this quest chain you'll see the rickety wooden tower with the Flying Machine at the top as you get to the first bend in the ramp.

\
Shadowforge Chanter - Priests, they bubble and therefore take longer to kill. They also run, make sure you stop them from drawing more aggro than you can handle.\
\
Stone Golem - Easy to solo, nothing special. Does a fair amount of damage.\

When you enter the fortress, there should be two guards posted at the main entrance. They are too close together to pull one, so don't bother trying. Inside there should be two or three warriors in the main room, easy enough to pull one at a time. Watch your back for a group of two warriors and a chanter that patrol the entrance from time to time. The left door should have two chanters, which you can pull. Follow the passageway to the room and there should be two warriors and a chanter, which you cannot fight individually. The barrel that contains the sack is just past the door on your right. On the right hand side from the stronghold entrance there is another passageway with two chanters, a mirror image of the left passageway. In the room at the end there is a chanter, a warrior and a stone golem, again you cannot fight them individually. The weapon rack is on the left wall, at the back. Search it for the rapier.\

\
Enter Angor Fortress, South of Uldaman (43, 30). Take the hall to the left and clear it out. Then go straight through to the next small room. As you go throught the opening to the room the \"Empty Barrel\" will be to the right (41, 29). After clearing that area out you'll be able to retrieve the \"Advisor's Pack\" from the barrel. Leave this room the same way you entered. As you leave the room, there will be another big room to the left. It was on the right as you entered the room with the barrel. Go into this room and you'll see a doorway across the room. Go through that doorway and clear out the area. Be careful not to aggro the \"Shadowforge Casters\" from the room on the left, where the \"Weapon's Rack\" is. After clearing that room too, you'll find the \"Weapon's Rack\" rack towards the back, on the left wall (42, 27) where you can retrieve the \"Advisor's Rapier\" from.\

Ordanus died, so I sacrificed my VW (he was about dead anyway) and downed the remaining mob pretty quickly.

First start by talking to Senani Thunderheart :\
The Ashenvale Hunt quest (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=6383) (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=12696). \
Then you kill the 3 mobs and each item will start its own quest turn in back to Senani @ Splintertree Post\
\
Ursangous's Paw: just north of the Talondeep Path (39.67) 1950 xp\
(http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=23) \
Shadumbra's Head: just west of Raynetree Wood (54.54) 2200 xp\
(http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=24)\
Sharptalon's Claw:   just south of Splintertree Post(73.61) 2450 xp\
(http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=2)\

    "49817664510176642006/12/20 20:30:48SaeljfkklhenThe premise of this quest is simple. Free two orcs from imprisonment.\
\
To free Drull: Enter Durnholde Keep from the South. As soon as you enter the fortress there is a bridge directly in front of you. Jump down from the left side of the bridge (There is a guard or two there, so be careful). Face East. In front of you there will be two buildings, one parallel with the South wall of the keep (it runs East to West) and another that runs parallel with the East wall of the keep (South to North). Fight your way to the first building (the one running East to West). Inside there will be a combination of the casters, rogues and guards. Also inside there is a Jailor. Kill him and he will drop a key. Use this key on the \"Ball and Chain\" behind the orc to free him. Sometimes you will receive a \"Failed Attempt\" message, don't worry, just keep at it.\
\
To free Tog'thar: Enter Durnholde Keep from the South. This time, cross the bridge and immediately turn West (or right). Continue a short distance along this path and it will branch Northwest (and up vertically), and continue Northeast. Choose the Eastern path and continue. A short distance up the Eastern path and to your right will be a razed keep. Make note of the keep and continue up the path. You should come across another jailor, either before the  destroyed tower or at it. Kill him and take his key, then return to the keep a few feet behind. Fight your way to the orc. Repeat the \"Ball and Chain\" procedure from Drull to free him.\
\
Congrats! You've just committed a jailbreak! Revel in your self-worth and value to the Horde!\

It is however easy to avoid, just walk up and hit the sleeped target with your weapon. Whats annoying about it is that it interrupts any spellcasting.",

Edit: While doing the quest to get the Blackhoof Armaments  I noticed they have a fast respawn time so you should not have to go in very far to get the 7 that you need to complete the quest as you can just go back and get the ones you already looted. I had to kill maybe 4 mobs to complete the quest, The Breakers have a knock back attack where they will launch you a few yards back and the Shape Shifter (I think) will spawn in 2 \"Ghost Wolfs\" that will despawn once you kill the main mob. Also don't forget to do [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=11201]The Grimtotem Plot[/url] while here!",
