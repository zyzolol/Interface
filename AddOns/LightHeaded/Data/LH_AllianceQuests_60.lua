Take out the other patrols first as they pass the south end of the pool.  Once they are all gone, clear the static mobs down one side of the room, working your way north to the area Velratha patrols.\
\
Velratha is not much more difficult than the other magic users in Zul'Farrak.  Her only edge is the ability to use a totem called \"Wrath of Zum'rah\" which summons skeletons.  You can counter this by assigning someone with fast attack speed to watch for totems, and have them attack the totem as soon as it appears.  However, it is possible to do enough damage to Velratha that she will wind up focusing on healing herself, thus never casting the totem.\
\
BTW druids, shamans, rogues and hunters should not pass up this quest even though the rewards are useless to them.  You get both of the items and 65s.  Selling both items should yield well over 2g, bringing the monetary reward close to 3g.",

Venture south, out of Gadgetzan and head towards one of the various giant rib cages (47, 43 - around here and further south) sticking out of the sand. Kill any bird-type mobs that hang around. The Giant eggs drop off these at a very good drop rate.\

Head east from Gadgetzan right to the coast, up to steamwheedle port. (66, 23) Kill the numerous turtles there. These mobs will drop clams which have the meat inside that you need. Simply right click on the clams in your backpack to open them.\
\
<< Alterac Swiss >>\
Head South-East from Gadgetzan towards the Cavern of Times (61, 50) Talk to the dragon inside just past the summoning stone and get a ride to the bottom. (Not sure what levels can do this, if you can't - just ride down.) Once you land, turn around and start heading back the way you came and you should see a tower with two NPCs outside. Talk to the NPC orc on the inside and he will sell you the cheese. (If you had to ride down, keep heading downwards until you see a tower on your left with the two NPCs outside)\

I opened it up, went ghost wolf to a clear area so as not to pull aggro, and pulled 2 of the pirates nearby and killed them (it spawned five, but they split into two groups in a few moments). Dodging the turtles again I ran back and opened up the chest and ran for it after it went into my inventory. Aggro'ed a turtle while I was there but ran until it de-aggroed. I got lucky and got a blue pattern from the treasure for Mithril Shield Spike! Also got Cuergo's Gold (of course), a couple greys and a pair of green boots.

\
- The beach is full of lvl 48-49 sea turtles (all hostile - not neutral as most turtles are in Tanaris) and it is a nice place to farm for leather without getting much disturbance from the other LW farmes. \
\
- Everytime you open the chest the loot changes. I noticed this accidently. When I first got the chest, it had some silver, two green items (one was a lvl 45 \"...of the Bear\" type mail leggings), and two grey items inside (two maces). I did not have space in my bags so I kept the items inside the chest and hearthed to IF. In IF, I emptied my bags and opened the chest again to get the items - and what do you know? I still had two grey and green items but they had changed to head band (greys) and \"...of the something other than Bear\" leather pants. The other one was a recipe. Sorry I do not remember what it was previouosly. \
\
I am not sure whether the items are completely randomly generated or rolled from a specific pool but you can keep opening the chest until you get something you like :-)",

    "2882133295301332952007/08/06 15:18:24LuckybucketFun quest with decent rewards, but rather annoying. Overall, it's worth it. Used 2 maps in one trip and walked away with 4 decent greens and some vendor trash. The pirates that come out to protect don't drop that bad either, at least another 10s or so.\
\
There are two locations in which I found with the Landmark: one at 50,90 and another at 54,95. I used 54, 95 and only encountered 50,90 when searching the area after completing the quest, so I cannot confirm whether it can be used or not, but it looks identical to the other.\
\
Anyways, when tackling this quest, find the landmark and search it. As far as I know the only way to reach it is swimming and walking on the shore to the east of the mountain range. When you search the landmark, 5 pirates will come out in a pattern somewhat like an \"S\". If you have AoE skills, take them out quick and easy. If you don't, such as a Rogue, take out the corners to kill them with 3 on 1 and 2 on 1 fights. Not too difficult. Most threatening thing is a turtle joining the fight, so take care of them beforehand.\
\
Once you kill them, get a key and open the chest. You should get about 2 green items, with a chance at some rares, and a total of 5-6 items, so have some space ready or open it once your in town to vendor off some stuff.\
\
This place is a pain to reach, so I suggest having some method of teleporting out, such as a Hearthstone, to avoid making the trip twice: once in and once out. If you die, then that's yet another trip, so be cautious and don't take any risks.",

Three spawned the first time, I was able to kill one and then had to vanish, but got attacked out of vanish, so I had to prep and vanish again. Another one had spawned after I killed the first one. Tried going back to them, but they see through stealth so I aggro'd. You can't pull them one at a time, as a Rogue anyway. I don't know what the above comments are about but when 3 mobs at continously beating on you, it doesn't feel like they hit weak and slow. I died after they detected me. Tried to go back to give it another shot, and killed 2 more but died again.\
\
I did notice though that as I was fighting on the metal rail/track sort of thing, if I jumped off, the [slow moving] parasites has to go a long way around to get to me. This occasionally gave me time to bandage and get some energy back, but didn't do too much in the long run.\
\
I went back yet again and there was only one left. This spec is fine for 1v1 PvE so I just stunlocked it to death. Tried summoning them again and another 3 spawned. I gave up at this point, didn't feel like dieing to mobs again.\

If you're a Combat rogue using swords you could probably do this easier, but if you're a dagger rogue...don't bother. They all have around 3K hp and hit for ~80 normal and crit for ~180 on 1.5K armor. There were 3 of em for me so I got hit and crit a lot.",

\
From thottbot, written by Shahwigs\
\
SOLO: 70 Demo lock, regular BC drop/quest gear.\
\
1) Have the key to scholo...\
2) Bring at least 10 shards, I did it with 5.\
3) Curse on Weakness is your BEST friend here.\
4) Enter scholo, 4 dead skelly warriors on the entry bridge. Single pull right and left front statics with Curse of Weakness. Dont send pet or you get ALL 4. The 2 in the back you will get together so just CoW them, throw some dots, tap tank, and HEAL Felguard. It's really not hard at 70 it seems, or CoW is just really awesome.\
5)Open the door and pull the roaming skell warrior you see. Go in room, go down to the right side corner and pull the roamers to here as they walk by. You can clear the close statics if you want. Go left across the room and through the other gate. I pulled the right statics next to the door, 3 mobs, but probably didnt have too as the other side didnt aggro when I went through door.\
6) Go in and turn left and you will see a long hall with 3 roamers and static bad guys on each side. You can ignore the statics and actually kill the roamers in the middle of the room without aggroing them. Go to the end of the room and open the gate.\
\
7) 4 roamers in this next room and 2 come close enough to the door to pull them outside the room 1 at a time. when this is done, go in and turn left.Straight across this room is where your going, but you have 2 roamers left, further into this room. stay in the middle of the hall and pull the first roamer to you and kill it all quite like in the middle of the hall. Careful not to aggro the statics on both sides.. The three static mobs in the center of the room can be completely avoided. Run across middle of the room, timing roamer on the other side, and pull him from the other doorway.\
\
8) Go through the door to the bird room, Aviary I think, and hug the left wall to the other end, you WILL aggro the far birdguy next to the steps down. Kill that set and go downstars to just outside Rattlegores room.\
\
9) Rattlegore is in the center of this room on a pile of bones. The 4 mobs, 2 in front 2 in back, are chained to him.I knew that from this board, but THIS is where I WIPED because I underestimated the these due the easiness of everything else I was owning. Pull the front 2 one at a time with CoW. In this fight you are a priest. Keep CoW on the mobs at all times, start tap tanking / healing pet EARLY, its like they have a dmg multiplier or something. Inch up toward the middle right and pull the right back one when it paths close. When it's dead, run around to the right of rattlegore and behind him on the back wall and pull the last one. Rattlegore himself is a bit harder than them in the fact that he stuns your pet and goes for you. stay back off him and do him like you did his minions. I ended up back at the door to his room with him when he finally droped. GET THE KEY to the Viewing Room.\
\
10) Go back to the first room you came in at, killing any roamers that repopped, I had one. Go to the exit and turn the direction you came in.Go accross the bridge on the right side and sac your pet. Jump down off the bridge to the far right corner, next to the Viewing Room door, and make a pet as fast as you can. A Glowing goul thingy will aggro and 2 non elite skellies will add.. Get them dead and open the viewing room door.\
\
11) Go in, All NON aggro, DONT talk to any of them, run accross the room to the next gate. Open it and go into the hall.\
\
12) You are now outside the lab, walk just inside the room and kill the 3 statics to the right, next to the alchemy table your going to use.\
\
13) Release Imp and let him do his imp thing. Imp Delivery Completed!",

1.get a friend to help (recomended a feral druid)\
2. kill the first 4 guards( bear form and use Demoralizing Roar ALOT as it will help reduce dmg takes by almost 20%)\
3.prowl to the first iron gate to you left as you enter the next room.\
4 from there on prowl to the stairs before the door to Rattlegore\
5. now Rattlegore has 2 npc in front of him you need to kill before you can get to him.\
6. kill the 2 trash in front of him and then kill him also( he actualy hits alot less then the trash around him just stay near wall as he will ocasionaly throw you)\
7. when he dies loot the Viewing Room Key and then prowl back all the way up.\
8 now at the room where you killed the first 4 skeltal guards you should be able to jump down as druid and kill the first group near the door and then get your lock down and go trough the door.\
9. keep walking as the next room is all neutral to you and go on to the next hall then room.\
10. in there kill the 4 trash groups( no need to kill the boss) and then release the imp todo his job and then your done\
\
took me around 30 tops to complete all of this with a lvl 70 feral druid and my lvl 62 lock\

use a VW to tank rattlegore, he actually dosn't hit as hard as the other mobs in his room, he has a temporary aggro reset though which is kind of annoying.\
after you get the key backtrack to the entrance (or just die and run back in) from here you jump down just behind the group at the door to the viewing room beneathe you. if you take a while to study the way they move you can move inside without getting aggro. otherwise ss ftw!\
the mobs in ras' room are cake, and the lab is just to your right. congrats you're done!",

Completely true for this quest. Standard escort tactics need to be used here:\
 - always let your protegee aggro the (group of) mob(s) first, let her tank while you kill the mobs one at a time... If her health gets low, try to get all the aggro...\
 - be careful with your own aggro, if a mob attacks you, the protegee wont always come to help you, you might lose important health/mana/time here.\
\
If you apply these tactics on this quest you might just get lucky.. Be careful with the blue demons that spawn, and let Arko'narin do the tanking. Kill one at a time according to what demon she is focussing. This is the fastest way to dispose of them.. At the end when you exit the \"dungeon\" the elite Trey spawns but after all the pressure inside, it's a nice change to kill an lone elite out in the open. He is quite easy compared to the rest of the quest.\

    "520311945150119452006/12/09 01:29:35OrmrissThis is actually not that hard of a quest, except when Arko'narin finally gets her gear. Once you get to the big room where her gear is located, she gets excited and runs right to it. She will likely pull two mobs. If you can get in front of her before she says \"There it is!\", you can pull the big blue demon standing against the right wall. He will come by himself and Arko'narin will help you fight. After you put that guy down, let Arko'narin run to her gear. She will likely pull aggro on another mob, and you want that to happen. This puts her into combat and keeps her from changing into her gear too soon. Take the mob down and then heal up immediately if you need it. It's important to be at full strength very soon.\
\
As soon as Arko'narin has her gear on, three blue demons walk into the room. She will charge them without hesitation. This is not as bad as it sounds, as she now has boosted armor and an enchanted sword. She also likes to use Mortal Strikes. Still, it's best to focus on whichever one she is attacking. You might also want to pull aggro on one, because she can't handle all three on her own. If you get aggro on all three, expect to spend some time in the air. The demons have a nasty pop-up attack and it can hit while you are in the air. They juggled my shaman for a few seconds. This limits you to instant cast spells and attacks.\
\
The good news is that if you had to kill everything on the way in with her, the respawn is such that you will pretty much just walk out after the three demon fight. You might have to take down three or four mobs near the entrance, but that's all. Once you are outside, you might also have to take out the two guards on either side of the door. After a few seconds outside, Arko'narin will be charged by a level 55 elite, the Spirit of Trey Lightforge. Despite his level, he is not too difficult. The Spirit has an attack that reduces your Shadow resistance by 100, and of course it uses shadow attacks. That's why you don't want to start tanking right away. It's best to throttle your DPS and let Arko'narin tank a bit early on. When you see her life start to drop in the 50% range, open up and pull aggro onto yourself. If you have healing abilities, you can start even earlier.\

\
Step 1: If you're entering his area via the narrow pass, clear the mobs in front of the pass or patrolling in front of it. NO need to clear the mobs adjacent to the path.\
Step2: Make sure to kill the named troll priestess that paths around the pool. She fears people so get her as far in to the pass as possible before dps'ing her.\
Step 3: The tank has to go straigh to the edge of the pool and pull the mobs near the gong to him and run back to the group waiting for him at the entrance of the pass..Clear that group.\
Step 4: Whoever has the mallet, go stright to the edge of the pool and then turn left to the gong (This is to not aggro the other mobs) and hit the gong and run back the same way to the group.\
Step 5: The tank goes straigh to the pool and pulls Gah'Zrilla to him and when the boss is closing in on him, he runs back to the group.\
Step 6: Tank the boss in such a way that only his head is inside the pass but the rest of his body is outside. This way only the tank will get punted. If and when the tank gets punted, he will land on top of the arch above the entrance and can jump down on the boss. To reduce damage, when the tank gets punted, shift to berserker stance and intercept him and switch to def stance.\
Step 7: Kill him. \
\
This way, you don't have to clear the entire room, just enough to summon the boss.\

    "2770541126054112006/12/03 01:34:29OrmrissOnce you are in Zul'Farrak, you can find Gahz'rilla's room by heading left when you can.  His room has a large pool with a gong at one end.  Before you summon him, take time to clear out some of the mobs in the room, particularly the patrols.  There are single patrols as well as multiples, including at least one trio of two hunters and basilisk.  Take special note of the mobs in the corners, as they can be hard to spot.  You don't have to get rid of them if you don't need/want them, but you need to be aware that they are there.  Also watch for patrols that come from the adjoining hallways.  You likely took out the patrols from one of the hallways on your way in, but the narrow hall on the east side of the room has one or two mobs that patrol into the big room.  Their patrol route is long, so you might not see them unless you know to wait for them.\
\
Hydromancer Velratha is also in this room, and is worth taking down even if you don't have the Tiara From The Deep quest.  She is a bit tougher than the usual mobs and would be a nasty add if you don't take care of her before you summon Gahz'rilla.\
\
If you don't want to clear the entire room, you need to take out Velratha and all patrols, then clear the static mobs closest to the pool.  Depending on how long you take, watch the hallways for the patrols to respawn.  They often come right up to the pool, and that will almost surely make for a wipe.\
\
Once you are ready, have a party member with the enchanted mallet use the gong while everyone else stands away from the pool.  The gong ringer in your party should also beat a hasty retreat as soon as they finish with the gong.  Gahz'rilla will exit the pool to the north, where the steps are.  He will pretty much hang around this area unless you attack him or get too close.  Once he's at the stairs, jump in the gong end of the pool and pull him to you.\
\
Gahz'rilla is a level 46 elite, but that level is deceptive.  46 is only a level or two higher than the general mobs in the rest of the instance, but he is much more difficult than that.  He has a frostbolt spell, a lot of health and a very nasty pop-up attack.  His pop-up attack launches you high into the air, which means a lot of damage from the fall.  This attack is not targetted and hits everyone who is close enough.  Mages and priests (who are way too close if they get hit by this attack...) can use Slow Fall/Levitate to avoid damage, but everyone else will have to take their knocks.  If you are fighting in the pool, you will hopefully land in the water, taking no damage.  If you fall on land, you will lose around 20%-25% of your max health (not current health).  Have a potion ready just in case, then jump back in the pool and move towards the middle.  If you can avoid the pop-up attack, you'll find that he is not too tough to take down.\
\
For those of you who missed this quest at first, or earlier scoffed at the Carrot on a Stick reward, and are doing this at higher levels, you won't need a full five man group to do this.  My 55 shaman and a 51 shaman paired up and we were able to go from the start of ZF to beating Gahz'rilla with no problems.",

The key is to get to a position where you *only* aggro Mother Smolderweb (as you're coming up the first ramp, the very far right corner should work I think), then have her attack and poison you.  If you are lucky enough, you can do this before she kills you (evasion might help here, I assume you can't dodge the poison effect).  Pop a vanish, get to safety, then hearth the heck out of there.  (setting your hearthstone up near Burning Steppes helps)\
\
A Druid can also probably do this if they can hibernate her after they get poisoned. \

\
A good spot to aggro Mother Smolderweb and to hearth out afterwards was the far corner, I found.\
\
One word of warning, though: I died once because I simply didn't notice that she had already poisoned me.\
I had already come here to post a frustrated entry about how I had held out sooo long and still died unpoisoned before I thought to check my combat log, where - right before I used blinding powder, so I must have been fairly down but still in the first half of the fight - it actually said \"You are afflicted by Mother's Milk\". So there it was, and I hadn't seen it. - Quite apart from the fact that the poison shows as a bright green icon where all the poisons and spells you have on you are shown. Duh.\
\
Anyway, in the next fight, I left my combat log on and kept a constant eye on it. \
\
So, if you're as blind as me and tend to ignore your debuff icons, you might want to go into this fight with your combat log open, as well.\

\
By the way, while you're stealthing through the Spire, this quest can easily be combined with the two pet quests given by [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=10260]Kibler[/url]:  [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4862]En-Ay-Es-Tee-Why[/url] and [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4729]Kibler's Exotic Pets[/url].\
\
Just make sure you complete the two pet quests first - I recommend to take all your clothes and weapons off while you do, since you need to stealth around a lot and might die a few times before you have all the eggs and the Worg carrier. THEN, when you're done with those, go back to Mother Smolderweb, put your clothes and weaponry back on, wait for your Vanish to cool down and engage her.",

There are four water towers that form a [b]T[/b] shape: a central one at 61,34 and three around it to the SW, SE and NE at 60,37 63,37 and 63,31. Stand at the central one and you can see them all.\
\
[i]Caliph Scorpidsting[/i] spawns at the Waterspring camp at 58,39 near the SW tower, but don't try to kill him here as there are two [i]Wastewander Shadow Mages[/i] with their voidwalker minions waiting to interfere with you if you do. He is accompanied at all times by two stealthed [i]Wastewander Rogues[/i].\
\
After a minute or two [i]Scorpidsting[/i] walks off to the central tower at 62,35. From here he walks back most of the way to his camp. Then he returns to the central tower and goes on to the southern one at 63,37. If he gets this far without being killed his two bodyguards disappear completely and he breaks into a run back towards the camp where he started. On the way there he also vanishes until he respawns at the camp once more.\
\
So to find him, look first at the camp. If he's there then wait for him to move off and get him between the towers. If not then go via the central tower to the south tower. If you don't see him on the way then he's dead and you should go back to the camp to wait for him to respawn.\

\
**You will have to check more cells, there will be more Patrols that you did not clear on the way over here that circle around from the other side, make sure you stand clear of them too. Respawn rates are slow you dont have to worry about that. It's also a good idea to let Marshal Windsor draw the aggro first, he is more armored than any party member and can be healed and buffed. Before entering a cell that Marshal Windsor asks you to open, make sure that its at THAT moment where you stop for a rest (regenerate mana and health and rebuff)\
\
For this, you will most likely a strong healer, a armored tank, and a Paladin to hog the Aggro from all other party members. Marhsal Windsor will attack at random, make sure you leave alone the target he chooses, as you would with a Hunter's Pet. When you breach the end of this event, talk to Marshal Windsor and then you are able to roam the rest of Blackrock Depths as you wish and leave him there. When you leave the instance, he will too (hearthstone, portal, walking, anything)\

Once the event is running, it can only be started anew by resetting the instance and clearing all the trash again, afaik.\

The most critical part of the quest is the storage room located near the end of the first circular path Windsor will be walking.

This room needs to be cleared of trash as well before starting the quest, since there will be several new spawns inside the room when the quest starts. (Afaik, Windsor will now open the door to this room prior to walking in. In previous game versions he did the Copperfield-thing and walked through the closed door.

The effort is well worth it, having a +100 hp enchant to your legs and head piece will make a big difference!\
\
First, night dragon's breath can be acquired in Felwood. Depending on whether your Alliance or Horde, you'll have to talk to the appropiate NPC to begin the cleansing of Felwood, which will involve you kill the Warpwood Shredder's in the northern part of the zone to collect shards. The Horde NPC that begins this quest is right off the road, a little further north than the druid tents and to the left. Once you've completed this first stage, you'll be given a Cenarion Beacon (hang on to this, you need it to collect corrupted soul shards!). \
\
Now you must collect six corrupted soul shards and in exchange, you'll receive two salves (And you need four to collect night dragon's breath). Corrupted soul shards have a chance to drop off any mob in the zone. Once you have four salves, you can cleanse the night dragon's breath plants. They are located at the following coords:\
\
1st Location: 35,60\
\
2nd Location: 50,30\
\
3rd Location: 40,78\
\
4th Location: 42,13\
\
Once you've cleansed the plant, you can collect the dragon's breath (usually yields 4-5 per use). Once you've collected from a plant, it takes about a half an hour before you can collect again. The nice thing is, if you hang around and wait, you can just keep collecting, you don't need any more salve! So I'll usually just hang around and keep collecting from the same plant.\
\
The rest of the quest is easy. Hop on over to the Blasted Lands (Horde have a flight path to Stonard in Swamp of Sorrows, Alliance has Nethergard Keep right in the zone I believe). A blood elf in the ruins near the entrance gives the quest for the lung juice.\
\
The scorpids are right near the entrance with the hyena's and vultures and the drop rate is fairly high. A little further south near defiler's rise you can find the basilisks, who also have a fairly high drop rate, along with hellboars, whose drop rates are quite a bit lower (This is what you'll be grinding on for the longest time). Remember when you're grinding that the hellboars, basilisks, and felhoudnds all share the same spawn point, so kill everything, it'll keep the hellboars respawning much quicker! There's also another variety of boar further east that will drop the blasted boar lungs as well. Once you've gathered everything, hope back over to Mathredis and you're done!",

\
1.  You begin in the Burning Steppes with the quest Dragonkin Menace, which is pretty easy.\
\
2. \"The True Master\" chain comes right after step 1.  You:\
a. Talk to Salomon in Lakeshire\
b. Talk to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in Stormwind\
c. Talk to Lady Katrana Prestor who is just across from Fordragon\
d. Talk to Salomon in Lakeshire again\
e. Talk to Marshal Maxwell back in the Burning Steppes\
f. Talk to Ragged John at the Flame Crest\
g. Talk to Marshal Maxwell again\
\
From here you need to go to Blackrock Depths and talk to Marshal Windsor.  He will tell you to return to Marshal Maxwell again with the quest Abandoned Hope.\
\
At this point, it seems the quest just runs into a dead end because Marshal Maxwell does not give you any further quests.  You need to go back to Blackrock Depths and kill mobs there for a random drop called A Crumpled Up Note.  Right-clicking the item will set you back on a quest to Marshal Windsor.\
\
Windsor gives you the quest A Shred of Hope, which is to retrieve lost information from Golem Lord Argelmach and General Angerforge.  You return this to Marshal Windsor.\
\
The next part is a bit hard - you need to escort Windsor from his jail cell.  Make sure the area is cleared of mobs before you do this.  The quest is called Jail break!\
\
After escorting Windsor out, go talk to Marshal Maxwell.  He will give you a quest called Stormwind Rendezvous, which can be done solo if you stay away from the battle.  \
\
Talk to Bolvar just after the fight.  He will give you The Dragon's Eye.  This means you have to go to Winterspring to find Haleh. \
\
After this, go to Upper Blackrock Spire and kill Drakkisath for the Drakefire Amulet.  Kill Drakk and loot the blood.\
\
Return the blood to Haleh in Winterspring and she will give you the key to Onyxia.  The Drakefire Amulet attunes you to Onyxia's lair, which allows you to kill Onyxia and return the head to Bolvar in Stormwind.",

\
First click the mound of dirt next to the gravestone.  The mobs walk in instead of spawning right away so immediately stealth.  Next, if you wait for them to get to the grave they start to mill about, which makes it a bit hard to position yourself, so distract them before they get to the grave. Cheap shot Mercutio and immediately use evasion.  This should keep you alive for most of the fight.  once evasion wears off, blind one of the graverobbers to try and lessen the DPS intake.  Also watch out for your health as you'll need that health pot eventually...  I was close to dying so once mercutio fell I Vanished.  His body didn't disappear or anything, so I waited a few seconds for a bit of health to come back.  Once I had some health I looted the corpse real quick and sprinted away.\

Started by clearing out all the trolls around the grave, and those along the fence and in the trees behind it. Earth shield up and dropped an earthbind totem behind the fence. Opened the grave and let the guys spawn, then jumped over the fence and stood behind the totem.\
Let them stop at the grave then pulled Mercutio with a lightning bolt, then used natures swiftness to cast another one isntantly. Then I ran around dropping earthbinds whenever the cooldown was up and using frost shock to slow him down (since it is off DRs again). Took about 4 tries sometimes I would get a troll or get gouged and beaten down. If you are a resto Shaman at level 55 I would recommend just getting some help to avoid the repair bill.\

The first gem is in Azshara (lvl 51-52 saytrs),  one in Felwood (in a cave lvl 54-55 doomguards), and one in The blasted lands (lvl 54-55 doomguards with 54-55 felhunter minions) Each dropped off of the 1st and 2nd mobs.\
\
Killing KROSHIUS is not that hard either, I did it at lvl 54. It all depends on your spec, I'm demonology and ran out of mana 3/4 of the way through. Different specs can do it at different levels. There are basically 2 options:\
\
Option 1: FEAR, DOT, WAND, FEAR, DOT, WAND ... DEAD.\
\
Option 2: Enslave a nearby infernal and go mortal combat on him with added DOTs.",

Jeadenar Fell Essence:\
In Felwood. (35,58)  Look for Jeadenar Legionaire underground. Very low drop rate, took me ages. But is possible at lvl 50 solo.\

The Dark portal Fell Essence:\
Blasted Lands. In the vacinity of the Dark Portal (58,50) Get Voidy (Felguard) to tank the Doomguards and banish the Felhunters. Hard to do at 50 as they resist, but possible.\

The part in Jaedenar was quite easy, i got a 54 pally that was running around to help me, the dude that drops it is a lvl 55 Legionnaire, he is not pussy, but i'm sure ur voidy should b able to tank him, idk the droprate for this guy, but i got it 1st try.",

Even if you can, you will more than likely get overtaken by their summonings, and patrols that occur.  I went there, changing from 68, 41, and I died before I even killed the first one.

Personally, I think this quest is great, especially for First Aid users.  The Runecloth drop rate here is great.  I started with 2 Heavy Runecloth Bandages, ended with 12, and that's with my use of them.  I didn't have to eat a single bit of food.\

Oh, and that Ghoul Rot debuff will hurt you.  It gives you a -10% chance to hit, which means you'll be missing a lot more often than normal, a LOT more often.

This will allow you to see all near by undead on the mini map and hover over the dots to know what they are. This will save you a lot of time searching for them, since you can just go directly to them! The elixir is not expensive and it's well worth it. \

2- If anybody else has this quest, do it together.. the spirit counts for both of  you, so instead of killing 15 each you'll just need to kill 15 total.",

This way you're not wasting rep.\

\
Make sure you have your Vitrous Focuser in the bag, if you dont have one you can buy it from the AD Alchemist in Chillwind Camp. Also remember to equip your AD Commendation trinket (Save all your scourgestones for when you hit revered).\
\
If you are 60 the best place to go grind  is The Ruins of Andorhal, I can get about 100 Osseous Agitators and 3 stacks of Runecloth in an hour worth of grinding as a Rogue, if you are a caster it may be a bit less due to downtime. For a lower level your best bet is going to Felstone Field itself. (Always remember that the trick of grinding is killing mobs that you can finish off in 20 seconds or less and that respawn fast). \
\
When you have a good amount of Runecloth and Osseous Agitators head to Chillwind Camp and buy some Arcane Quickener from the AD Alchemist (Those are expensive and if you dont use them fast they will despawn from your bags, so only buy what you need). Return to Felstone Field and use the cauldron to deliver the quest. \

This is easily soloable if you're ready to die for it.\
\
Mind soothe the gate guards and the paladins on your way to the town hall, run in and die in the far end of the town hall. Run in, rez and mind soothe the pallyes. Loot, fear if you get an unlucky add, run out. You can get outside of leash range before you meet another mob. Mind soothe your way out.\
\
Think this may be possible without death, if you know where the book is. First table in main room of town hall, btw. :)",
    "5168162581101625812007/10/03 22:55:11ZefyrusJust soloed with 55 combat rogue. \
Some tips to fellow rogues:\
\
- Carefull with the part at the barn, it's a bit nasty coz some undead tend to hide good but they can still aggro you and they won't hesitate to bring company with them. Clear the space behind the barn from any spiders/bears/undead and lure the rest over there.\
\
- One you get the shield, don't be afraid of the \"Haunted\" debuff. It's just an ornament. A ghost may spawn once in a while spamming stuff but luckily it's presence passes out of the attention of any mobs.\
\
Now for the Hearthglen part, it was the first quest where I had to face radar mobs -I call them that way coz they have this thing above their heads. They have almost the double aggro range compared to normal mobs and they see you in stealth like it doesn't exist at all. Even if you turn them around with Distract and get close to them (in order to sap or w/e), they will still aggro you, probably because The Scarlet Crusade has invented underground movement sensors.\
\
However, even though these sentinels have supernatural vision, they're probably deaf or dumb, meaning you can aggro any of the 4 of them guarding the gate without the fear of aggroing another aswell. So, do whatever is necessary to kill at least 2 of them so that you can pass unoticed (Evasion is required at every attempt to kill).  Don't worry, the respawn time is way too long.\
\
Once you get inside the fort, things are much easier. Just stay the hell away from other radar mobs and head to the City hall. Sap everything in your way to the main room. If you have cooldowns in your skills, I suggest you wait a bit until they're ready. \
\
Load up some mind numbing and crippling poisons, any agility/stamina/strength scrolls you have on you and prepare for a tough fight. Sap the left paladin, and kill the other VERY carefully, controlling him with stuns and kicks not to heal himself and not to start running around the room like crazy coz he might bring the other paladin in the room next door, ruining that way your hopes for ninjaing the book. Should that happen, Vanish and start over. Continuing our plan, kill the right paladin as fast as you can and trying to save as many abilities you can. Once he's dead, quickly move to the top of the room (if you haven't done it already) and bandage yourself. Kill the other mob saving kidney shot for when he starts running. \
These mobs use: \
- Heal\
- Bubble\
- A kind of strike (which damages you)\
\
When the second paladin hits the ground, go stealth -> sap the paladin next door (likewise \"girl next door\"), take the libram and gth out of there. Probably, the gate guards wouldn't have been spawned at that time, so you can go out the same way you went in. If, however, you enjoy danger -like me- you can train everything in your way using Evasion+sprint and spice things up! \

You can avoid fighting into hearthglen, if you have done the quest \"Scarlet Subterfuge\" before. Just talk to \"Myranda the Hag\", get the Scarlet Illusion buff and walk into Harthglen to get the book.\

\
The shield is the easiest, but watch out for aggro from the haunts standing around the grain silos (If you did the time rift quest in Andorahl for the bronze dragonflight you will recognize these structures).\
\
The book is in the main (large room) of the building at 42,19 on the table just as you enter the room. The building has a large clock tower. I had to kill 7 mobs to get the book safely.  I pulled the two guards in front of the gate to Hearthglen down the road a ways and feared them unto death. All of the mobs can self heal so this makes the quest difficult especially if fighting two at a time. I was able to go left upon entering the town and stayed close to the left wall and bypassed the mob just to the right. \
\
Follow the left path up around up the hill and the building is straight ahead on the left, next to the ballista missile sqaud. There is a 61 elite that walks up and down the road so watch out for him. I pulled the mob standing to the left of the stairs in front of the clocktower building down the road and killed him. The mob standing on the right of the stairs I pulled behind the building where I could fear him so he couldn't heal. This makes killing the mobs very easy. Next, I had a double pull from just inside the entrance, again, around the back of the building so I could fear. They died, but took longer. The little room just before the main room has one mob so I pulled him around back a took care of business. I then had my void attack the two guards in the main room grabbed the book and ran. I didn't use sacrifice since when you get so far away from your void he disappears you leave combat immediately and you get your soul shard back. Right before the entrance to Hearthglen I summoned my horse and fled cackling all the way.",

Was able to solo as a 56 rogue. When I was there the level 60 rare spawn was there in addition to the two paladins that are always standing near the item.

Kharan's tale proceeds as following:\
\
\"All is lost...\"\
\
[i] \"All is not lost, Kharan!\"[/i]\
\
\"Then listen well, <race>.\
\
\"Several months ago, the Magistrate of Lakeshire sent envoys to Ironforge, pleading with the King for assistance with the Blackrock incursions coming from Redridge and the Burning Steppes.\
\
Princess Moira volunteered to help, against my pleadings. I was assigned twenty elite guardsmen to protect the Princess through the perilous journey from the Loch to Lakeshire.\"\
\
[i]\"Continue...\"[/i]\
\
<Kharan clears his throat.>\
\
\"We made our way through the Searing Gorge tunnel and into the ravaged wasteland comprising the gorge. In retrospect, things were eerily quiet. The only dangers we ran across were the wildlife of the region: Creatures that my men easily dispatched.\
\
\"We reached Blackrock Mountain with relative ease and made our way through the stonewrought construction without so much as a hiccup.\"\
\
[i]\"So what happened?\"[/i]\
\
\"As we were making our way across the Burning Steppes, we were ambushed. It must have been a hundred of them... Dark Iron Dwarves! They were shifting out of the walls, from the rocks in the Steppes; out of every crevice, nook, and cranny in sight. They swarmed us, overwhelming the guards and the few brave heroes that had agreed to assist us on this mission.\
\
\"One thing was clear: This was a highly orchestrated ambush. It was as if they knew every move we would make before we made them...\"\
\
[i]\"So you suspect that someone on the inside was involved? That they were tipped off?\"[/i]\
\
\"How else could this have happened? Someone must have tipped the Dark Irons off.\
\
<Kharan shakes his fist at you.>\
\
\"So help me, if I ever get out of here, I will spend the rest of my days finding the traitor.\"\
\
[i]\"Continue with your story please.\"[/i]\
\
\"Where was I? Oh, yes, so we were captured. My elite guards men were captured on the spot. They spared me and took the princess away by way of ram. I was taken to the detention halls of the Slag Pit and then transferred to this prison.\
\
\"I can only assume I am still alive because they wish to extract a ransom for my pitiful life. Or maybe out of cruelty, as a way to let me forever play back the events that transpired in my mind. Regret is the cruelest jailor of all, <race>.\"\
\
[i]\"Indeed.\"[/i]\

\"She now resides at the side of Emperor Thaurissan. He has her under some sort of powerful thought altering spell... and here I sit, completely helpless.\"\

\
[ul][li] [b][u]MOST COMMON BUG[/u][/b]: Unable to hand it in....  If you find you've [u]completed[/u] the quest and cannot hand it in.. you have to find another unadorned seal of ascension. Link is here: http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12219[/li][/ul]\
\
[ul][li] Some problems result from [u]pet bar issues[/u]. These are easy and don't require for you to disable addons if you know what you're doing. If you're using ctmod or equivalent addon, then pet bar may be hidden. I recommend trying a quest that requires you to use it. If it works, great! If not it's most likely to be an addon conflict so disable your addons and it will work.[/li][/ul]\
\
[ul][li] Another problem where ppl may not be able to [u]mind-control[/u] it, usually because Health is not low enough- you'll get an emote when it is (usually around 10-15%).[/li][/ul]\
\
[ul][li] Not being able to [u]loot the seal[/u] is easy, I made that mistake, I was in a raid group. It's a party quest![/li][/ul]\
\
[ul][li] Try not to die before you mind-control or kill Emberstrife. This may cause some issues. Lvl 70 may require a healer. I did this with one healer as 70 rogue (with epic gear).[/li][/ul]\
\
Then the Vaelan will speak to you allowing you to hand it in.\

\
But yes, I confirmed this bug(yes it is a bug) tonight (Friday, April 6, 07)with a hunter friend, both of us are lvl 70 and we duoed the instance for the appropriate drops.  Vael would not allow us to complete the last part until we had each picked up a second unadorned seal of ascension.",

I died the first time but didn't realize he was fearable until it was too late.  2nd round went much better with the fears.\
\
I do think this is still bugged as I cannot finish the last turn in with Vaelan.  When I turned in my old pieces the first time he took them & all seemed OK, but once I got the seal forged & went back he is not accepting the \"Forged Seal of Ascension.\"  I guess that is what the bug is, not the initial turn in of the \"Unadorned Seal of Ascension.\"  Sux if they can't fix cause I don't think I'm gonna go through that again . . .  :(   Waste of a whole night tastes bad",
    "47431332801332006/09/12 23:19:27moslofHere is the short story...\
\
Go into the cave and find Emberstrife (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=10321).  He is all alone so don't worry about ads.  Have the guy who is making the key, use the unforged seal in the water below the island (out of the aggro range of the dragon).  Ideally, the same guy who needs to forge the key will also aggro/pull/tank the dragon...with others healing and helping with DPS.\
\
Get the Dragon down between 20% and 10% health and then everyone stop attacking...the guy who is trying to forge the key needs to use the mind control orb on the dragon.  (Note: if your a hunter/warlock you should dismiss your pet before this fight...cause the dragon becomes a pet once mind controlled.)  \
\
Once mind controlled, then use the first spell on the pet bar (orange block with with a black dragon on it), and cast the spell such that you hit the seal on the floor.  If you mess up and he breaks MC...just recontrol the dragon with the mind control orb.   \
\
The rest of the party should wait for the all clear (key needs to be forged) before finishing the dragon off.  In the mean time just keep that guy healed.   You can and should mana up while the dragon is under Mind Control.\
\
Once forged, then you loot the seal on the ground.\
\
Hope this helps.  I did it with 4 people, two 60 Shamans, a 60Hunter, and a 55 Druid.  A shaman and the druid healed, the other Shaman tanked and forged, and the hunter just DPSed.\
\
Final note:  If you happen to be killed after you make him cast his forging spell but before you can loot the object, the forged seal object will remain long enough that you can run back from the grave yard and it will still be there.",

Only one person has to mind-control Emberstrife and use the correct spell to forge them. Since the attack must hit all of the seals, it is recommended that you place them all together.\
\
If by some chance you miss one of them, someone else can mind-control him and try again. When I did this quest, it appeared that the attack you need to use in the pet bar (the left-most one) was usable once per mind-control, rather than having a cooldown.",

    "4743118973201189732007/07/11 08:58:20MareynWhen MC'ing Emberstrife, you will actually have *two* abilities that involve the breathing of fire.  One of them, the second from the left, has an icon with a flame on it and is called \"Breath of Flame\", \"Flame Breath\", or something similar.  This is NOT the one you want to use, as it does not convert an Unforged Seal of Ascension into a forged one.\
\
The other fire breathing ability, which is the first from the left, is actually called \"Flame of the Black Dragonflight\" and is the one you want to use.  Its icon is a yellow inscription of some sort that looks nothing like a flame.\
\
The reason I mention this is because when I did the quest, either something in my UI obscured the FotBD icon or I didn't see it in all the clutter, so the only relevant ability I saw was Emberstrife's standard flame breath attack.  Needless to say, I was frustrated when I used up three of my Orb of Draconic Energy's charges and the ability didn't forge the seal.  After researching more online and disabling all my addons to ensure that the FotBD icon would be visible, I tried again and it worked.\
\
It should also be noted that the Orb of Draconic Energy and the Unforged Seal of Ascension both have 5 charges each.  It is unconfirmed as to whether you need to redo the entire quest line--i.e., re-gathering the 3 rare-drop gems--if you use up all 5 charges; on Allakhazam's entry for this quest, a user named KEmperor reported in January 2006 that the quest could be abandoned and picked up again without having to re-collect the gems, but another individual on the same thread reported one year later that it wasn't possible, and that they had to repeatedly ask a GM to restore their gems before the request was granted.\
\
I had originally assumed that this quest was frustrating simply because collecting the rare-drop gems was difficult.  I was not aware that there was actually a very confusing and unforgiving quest that followed it; to top it off, as someone mentioned earlier in this thread, the quest has been bugged for at least 5 months such that even after you have the Forged Seal of Ascension, you need to re-obtain an Unadorned Seal of Ascension to complete the quest.  As such, this is easily the most poorly-designed quest chain I have ever undertaken, and I am very disappointed with Blizzard.",

\
The biggest problem presented when soloing this, is that you lose your off-hand slot. So, here is the trick. Use the totem to dispell his aura, then either fight it out till you die (or better yet kill him), or I guess running would work too. When you come back, you will be out of combat and the aura will still be gone. Just equip your off-hand or shield at that point. Prep and go at him again. I had about 6000 armor, 5000 hp and in defensive stance I only survived with about 130 hp left. Tried a fire protection pot, but those put your healing potions on cooldown. I think the only thing the FR would be good for is his fire shield that hits for 60-70 and a blast wave he does occasionally for 250dmg. He's mainly melee damage and with 6000 armor was hitting me for ~250. So, I elected to go with the healing potion. He didn't use the knockback on me once. So, not sure if I was lucky or if it's gone as of 2.3",

I've got 3 Morrowgrain in one opening and opened a total of 5. Do NOT do what i did, think it's smart to delete the Evergreen Pouch and buy a new one to avoid the cooldown, because it carries over and you waste 90s. The 10 min cooldown is highly annoying, but it's such an easy quest for a decent amount of xp.\

\
You'll find a variety of mobs around there, including:\
- Centipaar Swarmer\
- Centipaar Wasp\
- Centipaar Sandreaver\
- Centipaar Worker\
- Centipaar Stinger\
\
The Sandreaver and the Wasp are just easy fights, without any adds.\
However, the Swarmer calls in ads, which also damage you, and if you're a caster will prevent you from casting. If you can, lay down an AOE every 5 or 10 seconds to wipe all these little mobs. They have around 5 HP, and should be oneshotted with one AOE hit. I'm a hunter myself, and I used Volley to get rid of all the insects in one shot. Also Multi Shot works. For Paladins, try to use Consecration, Mages use Arcane Explosion. Any class that can't do AOE shouldn't try to engage these mobs around level 45-47, but wait untill level 49-50 or so. \
\
However, they can do the other mobs found around the area.\
Done this quest with a warlock, hunter, paladin, mage and a rogue myself now, and I've only had trouble with the rogue around level 46, for the other classes it was easy.",

\
A word of caution:\
\
The lvl 50 bug has a VERY small minion. You can mistake it for one of the critters Blizzard put in the game - it is not. Around the lvl 50 bug, look to the ground. It is very small. You might not even be able to click on it that easily, but it is a minion. Their walkpaths are not that similar either. Those two bugs might be far apart from each other.

Exit the cave. Should be easier to head east uphill to leave.\

Head back towards Thorium Point, continue past it to about 24, 29. It loooks a bit like a cobblestone path. Follow the torches a bit to your right until you see the lava pool. Clear the mobs. Stand on the Twighlight Artifact in the middle of the lava pool and click it. Lava gives a lot of damage, so be sure to do this.\
\
Return to the cave where you got this quest. I found it easiest to drop down from about 49,44 which lines you up with the cave that easiest to go back to. \
\
The Altar Of Suntara is next to where you got the quest. Click on it. 5,800 XP as of patch 2.3.\

The consensus on the Warrior version ([url=http://wowhead.com/?item=19782]Presence of Might[/url]) appears to be that by virtue of its Stam, the PoM beats the Glyph of the Defender.\
\
I suppose that after you've finished reaching uncrushable and are starting on the Stam stacking phase of being a Paladin tank, this would be an upgrade.  That completely relies on getting the Doll and a ZG group (the Presence of Might link says that Mandokir can be 3-manned with \"epic gear\" so YMMV) though and so the Glyph is FAR easier to obtain.  This is the one of the two head enchants available to Paladins with Stam on it though so it could possibly be worth the sacrifice.  The other being a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34330]Heavy Knothide Armor Kit[/url], so this one is more of a pain, but it does have some Def on it.",

There may be a difference if one is a herbalist, though.  I am herb/alch, and I usually get more Morrowgrain when it does proc than my hunter alt who is not a herbalist.  First time it procced, I got five Morrowgrain; three or four is more the average.\

Maybe someone can confirm this.",

Note: I am using a mod to show the reputation in numbers. This is not the same as Cosmos' digits. \
\
If you are unfamiliar with the mod: \
Neutral to Friendly: 3k reputation points required. \
Friendly to Honored: 6k reputation points required. \
Honored to Revered: 12k reputation points required. \
Revered to Exalted: 21k reputation points required. \
\
Darnassus: \
\
As 47 human mage, I got 4.7k experience points and 110 increase in reputation with Darnassus. So that is 100 for Gnomes, Dwarves and Night Elves. (Humans get a racial 10% additional reputation increase) Morrowgrain handed in: 10. \
Reward: Bag with randomly selected: potions, scrolls (extra stamina III, strength III etc.) and food. \
\
Follow up: 470 quest experience. And 27/28 increase in reputation with Darnassus. So 25 for Gnomes, Dwarves and Night Elves. \
Morrowgrain handed in: 10. \
Reward: That same bag again. \
\
Feathermoon Stronghold: \
\
Did it with the same character: 47 human mage. \
I received the same 4.7k quest experience for completing the quest. I also got that 110 increase in reputation. So like in Darnassus: This would mean 100 for Gnomes, Dwarves and Night Elves. \
Morrowgrain handed in: 10 \
Rewards: The questreward item and 10 Packets of Tharlendris Seeds. \
\
Follow up: Completing this will give you 470 quest experience and 27/28 increase in reputation (Yes, that's 25 if you are a Dwarf, Gnome or Night Elf). \
Morrowgrain handed in: 5 \
Rewards: 10 packets of Tharlendris Seeds. \
\
As conclusion: Handing them in at Feathermoon Stronghold is better. Ohw. And if you want to get to exalted with Darnassus: go for the cloth option. You'll get it way faster than handing in Morrowgrain. \
\
Edit: as of patch 1.9, it does not make a difference where to hand them in. Also note that the level of handing in Morrowgrain has been increased to level 55 (already in from 1.8 I believe). So I am not sure whether you can still do this quest at level 47.",

As soon as he rose, spam fear. He won't become hostile immediately so keep hitting it till you see it begin to cast. As soon as he begins running get ALL DoTs up, including UA and Siphon Life, and keep them up. Keep fear up, and if he resists it use Death Coil or instant Howl of Terror to give you time to recast. Make sure you keep DoTs reapplied. And do not try drain tanking, as he's just too hard for that.\

\
Start with Fear then CoA, then Corruption. Keep fearing at around 50% of duration of current fear just to be sure, plus Dark Pact when needed. I had to spam the instant casts due to resists. If it all goes wrong keep Death Coil at the ready and then spam fear right after that > once you get your distance again check your DoTs and reapply if needed - then check mana, then check distance - just repeat and with a little luck you should be fine.\
\
He had me down to less than 10% health each time I used a bandage. Make sure you bandage immediately after the fear lands, or potion + HS if you panic. :) Don't use mana potions, save potion cooldown for the health potion + HS combo.\
\
Keep your range also (I had my spells down the right actionbar in order to keep track of the red dots) Luckily at 50% he got jammed slightly behind a tree after running up the side wall so distance was easy to track. As long as you keep your distance you won't get beat down, concentrate about landing DoTs after you feel safe enough to fit them in.",

Start the fight, do NOT attack with your imp. Cast fear first, followed by curse of agony, and corruption if you wish. Kroshius is immune to fire spells, so no immolate. Apply Curse of agony and fear as necessary, and when he is at about 10 percent, feel free to nuke him at will. \

    "7603170024111574542007/10/16 20:20:36AulusActually, they can, indeed, be enslaved. I just killed Kroshius not 10 minutes ago using one of them.\
\
A couple notes...\
\
You can only enslave demons that are up to 3 levels above you with the rank of Enslave Demon that you have at this level. If you try to enslave one that's too high, it will say \"Target Cannot Be Charmed,\" leading some people to the assumption that they are not enslavable.\
\
Also, I don't recommend trying the following tactic unless you have Improved Enslave Demon. The reduced chance to have your (higher-level) minion break free during the (long) fight and the extra damage to help shorten it make this worlds easier.\
\
Now for the actual battle...\
\
Firstly, the infernals that you enslave are immune to most of Kroshius' damage. This immunity means that Kroshius will not attack the enslaved infernal unless it is the only thing on his aggro list, and therefore that you cannot attack Kroshius or aggro will be lost on the infernal permanently.\
\
Second, Kroshius will aggro directly to you when he is first summoned, so summon him and be ready to run away or die/Soulstone to de-aggro him. Don't worry, he won't despawn for a while. Now, go and enslave your infernal, making sure that it's at least level 53 (the highest that you can summon at level 50) so that Kroshius (55) is yellow to it.\
\
Third, tell your minion to attack Kroshius and sit back and watch the show. They'll go at it for a while, but not so long that the 5-minute timer runs out if your minion is 53 and you have the talent (I haven't tried it with anything less, but I had about a minute to spare at the end). Your minion is immune to most of Kroshius' damage, as I've said, so he can actually solo Kroshius.\
\
Fourth and finally, wait until Kroshius is one hit from death and kill him. I did it with a Death Coil, just in case it took a second hit.\
\
I hope this helps.\

make you have have lots of soul stones. res him and banish him straight off wait for him to start come out of banish time it right ( its not hard it tell u when hes comming out of banish.) and start casting soul fire. its a 6 second cast so cast it at 5 seconds before he come out of banish.\
then u can hit some quick attacks on him don't dot him no use with this tactic. banish him again when he gets to close to u run away from him and repeat till hes dead.\

Resulted in mobs hitting 200 dmg on me and im a mage =D\
\
So soloing this as a lvl 50 mage i experienced as quite a pain, since when i had cleaned the room to get this thing they all respawned and i had to go all out to escape XD\
\
In the end, i only killed the one to the right in the room where to get the hive, and then only slightly on the little pile there to avoid aggroing the other one. Takes a few secs to cast it.",

---------------------\
\
1.) Quest name: Dragonkin Menace \
Start: Helendis Riverhorn \
Location: Burning Steppes \
Level: 54 elite \
Notes: The NPC asks you to kill a number of different types of dragons in Burning Steppes. I did this at level 60 with a level 60 warrior and myself. If you do this at level 54, I would advise taking more than two people. Some of the dragons have rather high HP and do a pretty decent amount of damage. \
\
2.) Quest Name: The True Masters \
Start: Helendis Riverhorn \
Location: Burning Steppes \
Level: 54 \
Notes: The NPC asks you to deliver a letter to Magistrate Solomon in Lakeshire. \
\
3.) Quest Name: The True Masters \
Start: Magistrate Soloman \
Location: Lakeshire Town Hall \
Level: 54 \
Notes: You are asked to deliver another letter to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in Stormwind Keep. \
\
(Darkflame add: The True Masters -- Speak with Lady Prestor. \
\
4.) Quest Name: The True Masters \
Start: Highlord Bolvar Fordragon \
Location: Stormwind Keep \
Level: 54 \
Notes: You are asked to take another letter back to Magistrate Solomon in the Lakeshire Town Hall. \
\
5.) Quest Name: The True Masters \
Start: Magistrate Solomon \
Location: Lakeshire Town Hall \
Level: 54 \
Notes: Magistrate Solomon tells you to return to Morgan's Vigil in the Burning Steppes and to talk to Marshal Maxwell. \
\
6.) Quest Name: The True Masters \
Start: Marshal Maxwell \
Location: Burning Steppes \
Level: 54 \
Notes: Marshal Maxwell tells you to find and speak to someone named Ragged John in the Burning Steppes. He is located almost directly North of Morgan's Vigil near a cave at the top of the map. \
\
7.) Quest Name: Marshal Windsor \
Start: Ragged John \
Location: Cave in Burning Steppes \
Level: 54 elite \
Notes: This is where things start to get harder. You can start this at level 54, but I would not advise it until closer to level 60. Take a full group. You will be heading into Blackrock Depths for this. Marshal Windsor is located in one of the cells towards the right side of the entrance to the instance. \
\
8.) Quest Name: Abandoned Hope \
Start: Marshal Windsor \
Location: Blackrock Depths \
Level: 54 elite \
Notes: Again, take a full group of five. The more level 60's you have the easier this will be. Once you talk to Marshal Windsor, he tells you to leave him and talk to Marshal Maxwell again. So it's back to the Burning Steppes for you. \
\
9.) Quest Name: A Crumpled Up Note \
Start: Crumpled Up Note \
Location: Blackrock Depths \
Level: 54 elite \
Notes: After you talk to Marshal Maxwell, the chain seems to end. You must go back to Blackrock depths and kill enemies until one of them drops the crumpled note. It is a random drop, but luckily does not seem to take long to get. When you do find it, you must take it to Marshal Windsor, who is still sitting in his jail cell in Blackrock Depths. \
\
10.) Quest Name: A Shred of Hope \
Start: Marshal Windsor \
Location: Blackrock Depths \
Level: 58 elite \
Notes: Marshal Windsor asks you to find his lost information. There are two pieces, they are dropped by General Angerforge and Golem Lord Argelmach. \

\
Step 1:  The Paladin trainer in the Cathedral in SW gives you 2 quest lines to complete:\
--\
Step 2A: Emphasis on Sacrifice  (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7637) (Priest in IF)\
Just need to fork over 150 gold.  (And you thought Paladins got free mounts)\
\
Step 3A: To Show Due Judgment  (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7639)\
Take the Censer back to Grayson.\
\
Step 4A: Exorcising Terrordale  (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7640)\
Head to Terrordale in the NW part of the Eastern Plaguelands.  Stand in the green circles and push use your Censer.  Kill 25 of these dudes and head back to Grayson.\
--\
Step 2B:  The Work of Grimand Elmore (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7641)\
Head to the Dwarven District in SW and talk to him.\
\
Step 3B:  A Collection of Goods (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7642)\
You need to pick up a lot of mats for this step, and another 150 gold.\
\
- 5 Stratholme Holy Water (From the crates in Stratholme)\
- 10 Arthas Tears (Pick em if youre an Herbalist, otherwise get them from the AH)\
- 40 Runecloth (drops, AH)\
- 6 Arcanite Bar (AH)\
\
Once you round these up, head back to Grimand and shell out your 150 gold.  Then head back to Grayson to get the next step.\
\
Step 4B:   Manna-Enriched Horse Feed (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7645)\
You need to be friendly with the Argent Dawn.  Buy 20 manna biscuits from them and head to the horse trainer in Southshore.  Give the horse trainer the biscuits and 50 gold and youre good to go.  Once again, head back to Grayson.\
--\
Step 5:  Ancient Equine Spirit (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7643) \
Head to Dire Maul to find an ancient spirit of a horse.  In Dire Maul west there is a treant, Tendris Warpwood, that you need to kill.  Once you kill him, the spirit of the horse will come out and you can talk to it.\
\
Step 6:  Blessed Arcanite Barding (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7644)\
Talk to the horse, it will bless your barding.  Once youve done this, head back to Grayson.  Before you do so, pick up an Azerothian Diamond and a Pristine Black Diamond (both from AH)\
\
Step 7:   The Divination Scryer (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7646)\
Give the diamonds to Grayson and hell give you the scryer.  Make sure you have the blessed barding with you when you do this.  Hell give you a satchel that has the scryer and the barding in it.\
\
Step 8:   Judgment and Redemption (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7647)\
Take the satchel and a group to Scholomance and work you way to Rattlegores room. \
\
A quick note about groups.  A priest will be very necessary so that you can shackle.  The more pallies you have, the better.  Id recommend 3 so that you can alternate judgments.  A warlock would be nice for soulstone and overall dps, but if youre not worried about dying, you could throw in a mage or a rogue.  But for the final battle, paladins are more important than others.\
\
Clear Rattlegores room and have everyone stand in the corner to the right of the door.  One of the pallies needs to run to the opposite corner (as close as they can get) and place the scryer on the floor.  Once the scryer is down, the event begins.  It is important to stay as far in the corner as you can so that you can rest at points in the event.\
\
The key to the event is using judgments.  Each wave needs a different judgment.  Judging the correct spell on each wave provides you with an AoE shock on the ghosts.  The more paladins you have, the more often you can have the mobs stunned and the better off youll be.  Set up a judging order and make sure everyone knows the order.  Have the 1st pally judge the correct spell and then count to 5 and have the next pally judge.\
\
The order is Wisdom, Justice, Righteousness, and finally Light.  When you get down to the last ghost in the last wave, have the priest shackle it and have everyone mana up because once the last ghost is down, the charger boss shows up.  \
\
Kill him and youve got a shiny new epic mount!",

    "648100482201004822007/06/08 01:20:51davsfcI done this quest as a lvl 43 prot (AoE) pally, it took two attempts. The first time the chicken died when i bubbled against the Mage and the 2 assassins because he pulled all the agro. I healed and ruined their day (but really they had already ruined mine!). Anyway, next time i got through with no problems. Tactics: I killed the scopids pally AoE style (BoSanc, Ret Aura, SoLight, holy shield). I consecrated to pull any agro off the chicken. (remember we don’t want him to die!) This was the toughest fight by far. I think i even used Lay on hands after some wolf joined in. I killed everything slowly from then on so that my health and mana kept going up, BoWis, SoL does it for pallys. I changed to Prot Aura too for the chicken! Keep an eye on the chicken’s health; take as much beating as you need to so that he has time to heal. You can always take a potion or bandage. (I couldn’t heal the chicken). I switched to Shadow res Aura before i got to the mage and Co. Killed mage first, pulled the agro from the chicken with consecration. Then went back to pally AoE again to finish off the assassins. They dual wield so happy days. (The chicken doesn’t take well to dual wielders though!) He died quick the first time! There was no other trouble. Sorry this is really only a pally guide....\
The longest part of this was finding the chicken! Which got me killed once but the second time i pulled a lvl 50 basilisk and half way through that i pulled another lvl 50 giant bug that dropped critters. (they died on my BoSanc though! lol) I survived it though but the fight took so long the basilisk had disappeared (and i couldn’t loot it!) by the time I had finished off the bug! (really what happens is that you try and keep your health up (Jol Sol) while holy damage (ret Aura, BoSanc, Shield spike) slowly kills them!)",

    "648205518111906632007/12/22 10:59:24CelwindiaSolo'd this the other day as a 48 SPriest.  Instead of fearing ambushers for the escort quests, I usually try to find a different way.  \
\
The first group I thought would be like the previous groups I ran into, and come from a distance, so I mounted and scorpions spawn in a circle surrounding the chicken, and immediately start attacking.  Throw dots, attacks, or get some kind of aggro from all of them, and just focus on the one he's focused on.  For reference, I found my chicken was able to stay alive for at least 25 or so seconds, easily with one scorpion and poison on him.  If you're a lower level, don't attack the mob that the chicken is focused on, take 2 off of him, and take the 3rd when you've finished one, the chicken should survive comfortably, as should you.\
\
The chicken ran past or into several mobs on the way,  before, after, and in between ambushes.  I didn't find these happening too terribly often, every 20-30 seconds of dead time.  I just join him in the fight, these are typically single mobs, I got occasional doubles.\
\
The second group does approach from a distance, so I was able to mount and kite them, just running through, and then past the group.  The mage was only able to cast on me once, and the melees got 2 attacks per?  After seeing this was quite possible, I dropped mount and engaged.  I threw dots on the assassin's, and then just focused on the mage, they dropped with no fuss.\
\
A few helpful things to remember, I wasn't able to buff or heal the chicken whatsoever, but within 10 seconds of leaving combat, that cheesy NPC regen kicks in, and he's full in 2 ticks.  If his health is really low, and he's walking directly towards a mob, simply go to the side of the path, and pull the mob yourself, keeping it out of the chicken's aggro range, he'll walk right past, and you can finish the mob yourself.  Also, bandages are extremely helpful, just remember that they can be interrupted easily, wait until the scorpids' poison wears off before you bandage, or you'll have a minute to wait to try again =P  Hope this helps.  5450 XP\

    "90231294950129492006/12/10 18:40:19KillercricketThis is a single-part quest that was introduced in the 1.10 patch; the NPC is in Cenarion Hold, inside the inn, to the left of the innkeeper. As said in the quest text, you need to gather two venom sacs: one from Kurinnaxx, first boss in AQ20, and one from Venoxis, the easiest boss in ZG. \
\
Kurinnaxx is not hard, but if you don't know what to expect, he will give you a bit of trouble. Everybody in the raid needs to keep moving around to avoid sand traps; if the damage they inflict isn't much, and can be resisted (and absorbed with nature protection potions), the main issue is the silence effect, definitely a problem for casters (can't cast anything), and even warriors (you can't taunt or shout when silenced). Tanks will get tagged by him, the debuff increases damage taken and it stacks; it's crucial that when one tank has 5 or 6 debuffs, another tank picks him up until the former tank has lost the debuffs (30 seconds or so). So, warriors taunt and keep Kurinnaxx moving around to avoid sandtraps, and share the job as debuffs rain on them, melee DPS keeps moving along and burn him down. Avoid standing -behind- him at all cost, his tail does a very nasty cleave, hit his sides instead; don't stand infront of him if you're not a warrior, his frontal attack is even worse. Kurinnaxx isn't hard, and you don't need epic gear to win this, it's just basic group coordination and communication. \
\
Venoxis is the easiest boss in ZG, found on the south side of the instance past the nook where the bat boss/Jek'lik is (ZG is all nooks, there's no order in which you kill the bosses). 4 serpent adds, one priest that turns into a big snake. Have mages sheep and/or druids sleep 3 of the adds, the main tank picks up Venoxis and drags him to a corner; secondary tank picks up the non-sheeped/sleeped snake, everybody kills it, repeat with the 3 other adds. When all 4 adds are dead (they're easy), everybody moves on to the main tank and help him burn down Venoxis; the only real hassle with Venoxis is the poison clouds he spreads around (acid green clouds, hard to miss them), they hurt a lot if you stand in them. The main tank will need to move Venoxis out of those clouds, melee follows out and keep burning the big snake down. And that's pretty much it, hence why Venoxis is called the easiest boss in ZG (if you want a real fight, head over to Jin'do lol).",

\
When you're grinding(something everyone does no matter how far your guild has progessed raiding). If you use DS, you pretty much sac the voidwalker for the health regen. Without this trinket, even if you never die, you're looking at a soulshard every half hour just to keep your DS buff up to date.\
\
With this trinket, every half hour(coincidentally both the duration of the DS buff and the cooldown on this trinket), you can give yourself fel stamina for free.\

it is very rare to be out of mana or out of soul shards if you play like you're supposed to.\
yes if you play warlock but for some reason is not affliction then there are situations where you could find good use for it but it is not the obvious choice.\

I would have personally gained most from choosing the chest but since the staff looks cool (and I already kill everything too easy) - I took the staff. it's an addition to my collection of cool stuff that I will run around with when I'm 70, tiered of farming and have no raid.\

\
Yes the Robe and Staff are nice... BUT you will replace them very soon.  The Trinket, while you may not use it right away, very well might be very useful someday, even at level 70!\
\
An example, in the Demonology tree there is a spec type that is dependent on summoning your Voidwalker and then sacrificing him to get major regen back for 30 minutes.  What if Blizzard decided to make this spec really awesome someday?  You'll be glad you still have this trinket that has it situational uses instead of a Robe or Staff that you vendored when you got to level 59.\
\
And the trinket might have some other interesting uses here and there, yes even at level 70.",
    "8422153062111515312007/09/14 18:50:25ShadownoobFirst of all, the Soul Harvester is FAR superior in EVERY way to the Soulkeeper.  More stamina, some spell hit, and most importantly, more spell damage.  Spirit is almost useless to a warlock.  Saying that Soulkeeper > Soul Harveseter is just...laughable.\
\
As for the Abyss Shard, I personally almost never use my Voidwalker anymore, as an affliction warlock, aside from using him as the sacrificial lamb to nab quest items.  In my opinion, the shard is the most unique item out of the bunch.  That said, it's still pretty useless ever if it has a unique effect.\
\
In my opinion, one should go with whatever gives the best stat upgrades.  In my case, I'll be choosing the staff because the robe, while nice, isn't a large upgrade because I have a Robe of the Magi with a +150 health enchant, and I really don't feel like getting another enchant when BC items are right around the corner.  The staff though is a slight upgrade from my Hypnotic Blade/Umbral Crystal combo, plus it looks cool.\
\
TLDR version: Uniqueness != Usefulness.  A unique pos is still a pos...usually.  But I'd rather have a constant improvement over a novelty item like the trinket.",
    "842248447048442006/11/27 13:37:12rlyehExactly.   Later on towards end-game the trinket will still retain some marginal value as it will save you a soul shard and lots of mana.  It's nice to have, but not a big deal.   \
\
It helps when grinding or with repeated boss attempts... or in the middle of a boss battle and your pet goes down, but you need more dps - or another off-tank for adds.  Lots of neat little uses, but nothing major.   Still through time it will hold it's value longer than either the scythe or robes.   \
\
The only reason not to take the shard is if you are levelling very quickly and just want something to replace your staff/robe for the moment. \
\
Basically the choice is Abyssal Shard, Large brilliant shard, or large brilliant shard.   (if your an enchanter). \

And when you don't use the Voidwalker, this thing is just useless. I for one, as a destruction Warlock, prefer to be hit (backlash doesn't proc like Nightfall, on damage done by a spell..?) so I use a (sacrificed) Imp, maybe a succubus or a Felhunter.

2. Shadocast Tunic http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31717\
there still remains a use for this, as well as the staff, which I would disreccommend due to the fact that Hypnotic Blade (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=7714) + Orb of Dar'Orahil (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=15108) gives you only -1 Shadow Spell DMG, and although you do miss 16 Sta (Stat #1 for locks indeed) and spell hit rating, I think the Robe is a better choice due to the fact that it's better than;\

\
I got the feeling that picking the trinket in this quest would put me back in that same position. Great, a unique trinket, but simply not worth the hassle of equipping, doing your thing, then swapping back to your normal trinkets.\
\
Truthfully, while leveling my lock up to level 58 right now, I have only ever been short on shards once (though I have never ran out of shards).\
\
Knowing all that, I picked the weapon simply because I can look cool while walking around town with it. I suspect if I had taken the trinket that it would be gathering dust in my inventory or bank.\
\
Really, if you're that critically low on shards that often, to make having this trinket even an issue, I think you'd seriously have to examine your playstyle.",

A)\
The succubus is your favorite minion. You are out of Soul Shards and your succubus isn't summoned. Not one mob that generates XP is in sight. You want to summon the succubus. What will you do?\
1. Use the Abysss Shard to summon the Voidwalker.\
2. Tell the VW to Stay.\
3. Run away from the VW until it is out of sight: You will get a Soul Shard.\
4. Summon the succubus.\
\
B)\
You are a Demonology spec Warlock. You are in a tough battle, solo. Both your HP and mana are low, and you are getting aggro. Your minion's HP is low too. What will you do?\
1. Cast Fel Domination and use the Abysss Shard to summon the Voidwalker. \
2. Choose to sacrifice the VW and run away (to fight another day) and/or choose to let VW attempt to tank (giving you time to use pots and/or bandages).\

I am sure there are other senarios :).\

Each quest reward has advantages: Who am I to say that choosing the staff or the robe is \"wrong\"?

\
[INT/29.5?]%\
\
This gives us .27% crit chance for 8 Int.\
\
Now, also assume that paladins have Divine Intellect, and Blessing of Kings, that increases the 8 int to about 9.6 (or 9.68, however, they do the math) int.  Assuming they round up, that's 10 int.\
\
Compare this to the ZG enchant, which give us 10 Stamina, 24 healing, and 7 defense.  Assuming at this point that defense is all but useless for a current end-game raiding paladin, it comes down to +healing and stamina and more mana and spell crit.\
\
With two enchants, you have the following totals:\
\
ZG: 48 +healing, 200 health\
LIbram: 20 Int (assuming BoK and DI talent), which gives us .54% spell crit, ~300 mana\

\
5/5 Demonic Embrace will raise your STA gained by 15% -- 9.2 STA. That will be equal to 90 or 100 HP, depending on the rounding with the rest of your gear.\
\
In addition to the 90/100 HP:\
\
+ Your pet's STA will be based off of a percentage of your STA, not your HP.\
+ The percentage of +9.2 STA going toward your pet will be increased by another 15% with 3/3 Fel Stamina -- a percentage of +10.58 STA.\
+ And then a percentage of this increase in STA will be added by 3/3 Demonic Knowledge as an increase to spell damage based off of 15% of your pet's total STA and INT.\
\
+8 STA is vastly superior to +100 HP. Equivalent HP gain, more HP for your pet, and more +spell dmg for you.\

And if you're ever buffed with Blessing of Kings, that's an extra 10% STA right there. +100 HP will always be only +100 HP.",

\
Prior to downing Valthalak we killed Ossirian and Nef on the same night. Of the 3 fights everyone in my group agreed that Valthalak was the most difficult. I am not sure if Blizzard scales the difficulty depending on your gear but considering how much trouble we had with him this is definitely possible. \
\
Our group consisted of the following \
\
1 Warrior \
2 Paladins \
1 Priest (me) \
1 Warlock \
3 Rogues \
1 Mage \
1 Hunter \
\
Almost all players had some tier 2 and a good amount of tier 1. I personally had 3 tier 2 and 3 tier 1 with Benediction. \
\
Our strategy for our successful attempt went like this: \
\
Our tank pulled Valthalak to the wall where you stage to kill the Beast. He was accompanied by 1 rogue to kill adds that appear close to Valthalak. All others stood back and DPSed with a primary focus on the adds. The lock and occasionally the hunter focused on burning his mana. This is very important as when he has mana he seems to heal himself. Our mage also hit him with improved counter spell whenever possible. \
\
After 40% stage 1 ends and it is an easy fight as it is just a matter of DPSing him down and keeping the main tank up. \
\
Vent was very helpful as we could call out when we were being stunned so that no one died due to being stunned for the full 8 seconds. \
\
Even with this strat it was not easy and did not go perfectly. I died just as stage 1 ended as he hit me with a shadow bolt that did 4700 damage. Our tank died when Valthalak had about 10K health remaining as our palies were out of mana. Thankfully the remaining members were able to do some awesome DPS and finished him quickly. \
\
Things to remember \
\
1  Burn his mana \
2  Kill the adds as fast as possible",

Blizzard GMs will unfortunately be entirely unhelpful if you need to re-learn these recipes and can't find the coins to do it, so if you like to have every single recipe in a profession and have already done the coin quests, think very carefully before you throw away engineering.",

To get to the Searing Gorge, go to the Bad Lands and go to co-ords 6, 30. There should be a path somewhere there. Then, once you're in SG, go to co-ords 68, 34. You should see a camp full of dwarves holding poor Mentzel hostage.\
\
Okay, first take out one of the patrolling dwarf by using a ranged weapon to lure him to you, you don't want to be mobbed. After the battle, rest until you have full health. \

Then, cast Retaliation and run like hell to Mentzel. Once you have talked to him, Mentzel should fly out of there safely and you should have completed the quest. Too bad you'll mostl likely die. Just be sure you can harth out of there.",

\
1. Enter Jintha'Alor, you'll notice it's full of nasty troll elites.\
2. Work your way to the top of the \"temple\" (i suppose you can call it.) This isn't hard, just follow the roads and go up every set of stairs you come across.\
3. Keep gonig up until you see a the cave that is marked on your map. This is not the right cave, but it is close to it.\
4. Facing the cave, turn left. It is the very left route. You will enter a very opened - spaced, what you might call, ritual area. It is guarded by elite dogs, elite guards, and a named NPC. \
5. You will see also there is an altar in the middle of this place, with a horde troll on it, in a dead position. This marks the entry to the cave. The cave entrance is around where the troll is.\
6. Work your way through the cave. This may require some naked suicidal runs to save repair bills, and lots of corpse runs, which thankfully, are around the horde base, so it isn't too far. \
7. You'll come to the end of the cave, where there is another named NPC, and two guards patrolling in circles around the egg. It is very hard to kill these people to reach the egg, and can only be looted if they are not attacking you somehow. You cannot be bubbled, stealthed etc. I suggest bringing a friend with you so u can ninja loot it ^^\
8. Get the hell outta there, and pray you will never have to return. : )\

OK here are the exact steps to get the Sprite Darter since many people seem to be confused on how to actually get it. Just remember you need to be level 38 to qualify for this quest.\
\
1. Go to find Kindal Moonweaver, who gives you a quest called Freedom for all Creatures. She is not easy to locate. Her coordinates are 65,46, and to reach her, you need to walk up a ramp up against a cliff hidden behind a tree behind the Tauren village. Follow the ramp up, and you will see her and another NPC called Jer%u2019Kai Moonweaver overlooking the Tauren village.\
\
2. After the Freedom for all Creatures quest, talk to Jer%u2019Kai. She gives you a quest called Doing Justice. After that quest, she sends you to Darnassaus.\
\
3. After getting your reward at Darnassaus, go back to the Tauren village and talk to Jer%u2019Kai again. She gives you a quest to bring an egg to Quentin at Thousand Needles.\
\
4. Keep doing the link of quests after, and you will eventually get the Sprite Darter pet!",

\
However, neither Shy-Rotam or Siam Rotam are elite, they are regular mobs and easily soloed by any class now. It does seem like you might be able to kill Shy-Rotam fast enough to avoid her calling her mate, Siam Rotam spawned at 8% when I just did the quest.",
    "50561821070182102006/12/28 01:10:32OrmrissTried this with two shamans, me with a 60 restoration-spec shaman and my brother with a 59 elemental-spec.  We did ok starting off, though we did pull an add thanks to Shy-Rotam's fear.  It seemed like she used that every 15 seconds :)  Anyways, once she hits about 50% health, she summons her mate, also a level 60 elite.  This is where we wiped.\
\
I scoured the web for strategies, and read a suggestion that said hunters could start the fight, then kite her back to Everlook and have the guards there help kill her.  Taking that into account, we tried again.  This time, I tried kiting her with Frost Shock.  It was incredibly successful.\
\
Frost Shock slows the target for eight seconds, but only has a cooldown of six seconds.  What I did was cast Frost Shock to start off the fight, then ran towards the road.  If you use this strategy, note that you'll want to clear the frostsabers from the road beforehand.  I simply ran down the road, turning to cast Frost Shock whenever it's cooldown finished.  It's worth noting that at this point, I had about 5400 max mana, as well as the Elemental talents that increase Shock damage and decrease Shock mana cost.  Even with all that I still had to use a superior mana potion a ways down the road.  I was able to stay way ahead of Shy-Rotam, and well out of range of her fear.  Not only that, but once she got down to 50% health, she called for her mate, who did not appear.  My guess is that he spawns back at Shy-Rotam Rock.  I was so far off that he either never caught up or did not give chase.  Regardless, he was not a factor, and once Shy-Rotam got to around 10%, I dropped a Tremor Totem (to break Fear) and closed to finish the fight with melee and Earth Shock.\
\
My brother only used one Frost Shock, and that was at my suggestion, as a way for me to save a little mana on the road.  There was also a level 57 Alliance hunter who saw us and fired on Shy-Rotam a few times, but his damage was fairly small, mainly Concussive Shot (I assume he was trying to avoid pulling aggro).  After killing her, I still had about 800 mana and about 70% health.  The removal of her mate was the dealmaker here, so I recommend kiting her down the road if you can.",

\
She fears, as well as does a bleed effect. Not too hard though, just be careful, because she summons an add of equal power (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=10741) after you've weakened her some. Killing Shy-Rotam completes the quest though, so you can vanish / run / FD / etc at that point.",

What you will need to do in order to get your kills is plant yourself in one of the Furbolg 'villages' on either side of the road in western Winterspring and kills mobs as they spawn in.  Expect to be competing with at least one or two other players for the kills, and don't be surprised to see mega-geared level 60s among the competition.  These Furbolg drop items needed for Timbermaw reputation, which is why competition is usually fierce.\
\
I recommend getting all your Pathfinder and Totemic kills in the western part of the zone, then heading east of Everlook to the other big Furbolg camp.  There are many Den Watchers outside the camp, and they tend to garner less attention.",

    "114541634061101634062007/10/05 16:45:24SilentviperThis quest can be started hourly, when the Dark Iron Invasion pops up again at xx:30. You have to find Coren Direbrew in Blackrock Depths. This guy is a bit hard to find if you don't know where to start looking for him, so i made a little walkthrough.\
\
First of all you got to have the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=11000]Shadowforge Key[/url], because you will need it for a few doors and a lever further along the way.\
As soon as you come through the BRD portal take a left but don't go to the Dark Iron Highway. Instead turn right and open the small door, immedately taking a left to open another door.\
In here there's a lever you need to pull for the bridge to lower up ahead.\
Once you've clicked the lever head up the ramp and cross the now available bridge.\
Work your way past a few groups of mobs at the other end of the bridge and you should pass [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=9033]General Angerforge[/url]. Head into the room adjacent to the general's room and then don't go straight ahead to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=8983]Golem Lord Argelmach[/url], but instead turn right past the room with the mechanicals and head through the passage there.\
Once you're in the Grim Guzzer you should see Coren walking up and down the room, but as soon as you approach him he runs away into the nearby hall. He hides near the Thorium Brotherhood questgiver so that's where you can complete the quest and receive your [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34140]Dark Iron Tankard[/url], which gets you \"completely smashed\" instantly.\
\
Hope this helps you guys find him too.",
    "11454163618101636182007/10/06 06:39:00LieandraYou should note that getting to the Grim Guzzler is nothing new as a very good dagger drops from within. The [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12791]Barman Shanker[/url] drops from [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=9499]Plugger Spazzring[/url] in the Grim Guzzler. As a result, there are a lot of [url=http://www.worldofroguecraft.com/shanker.html]guide[/url]s to getting inside of the Grim Guzzler.\
\
As a rogue, you can solo this particular quest as early as lvl ~50-52 as you need a minimum of 250 LockPicking for the 2 gates, the 1 door, and the 1 Gear. The gear will take some really good timing, but if you are a good enough rogue (know how to play your class), it will not be a problem for you. \
\
Technique: The far left corner of the gear room has two dwarves. You need to Sap the one closest to the corner, and then position yourself just close enough to the Gear (when you can first use the LockPicking ability) and the second dwarf to avoid agro from the other dwarves on the right and the dwarves behind you (the ones near the entrance), while LockPicking. \
\
At that position, you Blind the second dwarf and click on the gear. The Sap time and Blind time will be enough for the Lockpicking time of the Gear. (You can fail lockpicking, so trying again from fresh Cool Downs may be needed.) You must be aware of the one Fire Elemental pat, and be sure to await his leave before beginning.\
\
A successful Lockpicking of the Gear at low levels will agro the other dwarves in the room. At this time Vanish and they should all reset. Then you may continue to the Grim Guzzler.  Failing will require you to wait for BOTH Cool Downs (Vanish and Blind).\
\
Also, note that if you are Stealthed and inside the Grim Guzzler (I was curious). When you near Coren Direbrew, he will still run and hide in the back room.",

    "914214142110141422006/12/12 13:06:56kreghxOk, so I tried a little experiment to see if the Craftsman's Writ quests are worth repeating. I'm a L60 Warlock with 300 Tailoring/300 Skinning. The first quest I got was for tailoring (Brightcloth Pants) so that wasn't hard for me to complete and didn't cost me much to speak of. I'm sure my gains were whatever the typical first turn-ins are. \
\
For accepting the 2nd crafting quest (therby consuming the valor token), I got +11 rep (I'm currently at honored). The second quest was for Rugged Armor Kits, which I can't make so I went off to the AH to check them out. About 1.18g on my server and I needed 25. For the sake of the experiment, I bought them, having 3 kits left over owing to the way stacks were offered at the time. I used the 3 extras on my non-enchanted items for +120 armor (not bad at all for a squishy warlock). When I turned in the quest (therby consuming the 25 kits and the writ itself), I received +55 rep (and I forgot whether or not I got any gold for the turn-in, even though in retrospect, that was a pretty important detail...doh). Anyway. \
\
rep for accepting quest: +11 \
total cost of items: 33.04g \
armor gained: 120 \
rep for completing quest: +55 \
gold received for completing quest: ? (if any) \
\
So, for the sake of comparison, let's say I just used a Valor Token and bought 3 rugged armor kits... \
\
rep for using a token: +27 \
total cost of items: 3.54g \
armor gained: 120 \
\
The difference is \
-29.5g \
+39 rep \
or .76g per rep point \
\
Of course, all of these figures will vary depending on your current reputation level, market prices of items, and what crafting quest the guy gives you, but I'm putting this up as a \"for instance.\" \
\
Conclusion: In this experiment, I ended up paying .76g for each rep point I gained over and above what I would have gained by just using the Valor Token. Now, I prefer to run around and kill monsters and sell what they drop in order to make money rather than paying gold for rep points, but some players might be happy to do that. Decide for yourself whether or not it's worth repeating, but for my money and time, I'll just be using the tokens I get for now...",

\
Process is as follows:\
\
STEP 1:\
Obtain 4 sets of Twilight Trappings http://www.wowhead.com/?itemset=492 (head, shoulders, and chest) by killing the any of the humanoids at the twilight camps.  Drop rate on each piece is 4%, so on average you will get one set every 25 kills.  That's \"on average\", so expect to have lucky streaks and unlucky streaks.\
\
STEP 2:\
Wear a set of Twilight Trappings.  Click on a LESSER WIND STONE.  A dialogue box opens with only one option.  Before you click on it, equip you normal head, shoulder, and chest gear as you will soon be fighting.  Click on the dialogue option.  In a couple secconds, a flash of lighning will strike you (does no damage) and one set of Twilight Trappings will disapear from your inventory.  A Templar will appear at the stone.  For about 5 seconds it will just sit there and can't be attacked yet.  Then it goes aggressive on the person who did the summoning.  Kill the Templar, and loot the Abyssal Crest.\
\
STEP 3:\
Repeat step 2, and then repeat it again.  You should now have 3 Abyssal Crests, and you should still have one set of Twilight Trappings.\
\
STEP 4:\
You will now need 1 Large Brilliant Shard, and you must be friendly with Cenarion Circle to continue.\
Do the \"Aurel Goldleaf\" quest from Huum Wildmane if you haven't done it already.  Complete that quest by talking to Aurel Goldleaf.  For the follow on quest, give her the 3 Abyssal Crests and the Large Brilliant Shard, for which she will give you 1 Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station.\
\
STEP 5:\
Go back to one of the Twilight camps and find a WIND STONE (not a \"lesser\" and not a \"greater\").  Clear the area around the stone.  Put on a set of Twilight Trappings and also put on the Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station.  Click on the Wind Stone.  You will see a dialogue box, just like in step 2.  Switch back into your normal gear.  Click on the dialogue option.  One set of Twilight Trappings and the Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station will disapear from your inventory, and one of the 4 DUKEs will be summoned.  As before, there is a 5 second pause before the Duke will go agro.  Kill the duke and loot the Abyssal Signet.  Note, if you fail to kill the Duke, or it evades for any reason, it will despawn and you have to start all over from step 1.  You do not get any of the materials refunded to you.\
\
STEP 6:\
Go back to Bor Wildmane and turn in the Abyssal Signet for your reward.\
\
REPEATING FOR MORE TURN INS:\
You can turn in more Abyssal Signets to get more rewards, but each turn in after the first requires 3 Abyssal Signets.  You have to repeat steps 1 - 5 for each Abyssal Signet, so that's 3 full repetitions to get another Sack of Spoils.\
\
Is it worth it?\
My first time doing this was solo as a 70 BM hunter.  The randomly summoned duke was the Duke of Shards, who I downed with no trouble.  The duke dropped Abyssal Plate Legplates of Restoration http://www.wowhead.com/?item=20671\
I turned in the quest, opened my Sack of Spoils and got Lord Alexander's Battle Axe http://www.wowhead.com/?item=13003\
From wowhead's loot tables:\
Getting a BoE blue drop from a duke is about a 25% chance.\
Getting a BoE blue drop from the Sack of Spoils is also about a 25% chance.\
It can be a fairly time consuming process to go through and the odds of getting nothing are fairly high, so weigh the cost before you set out on this venture.",

Just be careful of the mechanical chicken bugging out and going on evade.  If you're facing the cave, if you pull Clunk outside he'll path to the right and over a small rock ledge.  If you're standing on the metal and not the rock sometimes he'll go on evade as he paths to the right.  Happened twice to me, then I realized I was standing on the metal both times.

\
To get your key to Onyxia, you must go to Morgan's Vigil in the Burning Steppes. That is where the chain starts.\
\
1.) Quest name: Dragonkin Menace (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4182)\
Start: Helendis Riverhorn\
Location: Burning Steppes\
Level: 54 elite\
Notes: The NPC asks you to kill a number of different types of dragons in Burning Steppes. I did this at level 60 with a level 60 warrior and myself. If you do this at level 54, I would advise taking more than two people. Some of the dragons have rather high HP and do a pretty decent amount of damage.\
\
2.) Quest Name: The True Masters (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4183)\
Start: Helendis Riverhorn\
Location: Burning Steppes\
Level: 54\
Notes: The NPC asks you to deliver a letter to Magistrate Solomon in Lakeshire.\
\
3.) Quest Name: The True Masters (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4184)\
Start: Magistrate Soloman\
Location: Lakeshire Town Hall\
Level: 54\
Notes: You are asked to deliver another letter to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in Stormwind Keep.\
\
(Darkflame add: The True Masters -- Speak with Lady Prestor.\
\
4.) Quest Name: The True Masters (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4186)\
Start: Highlord Bolvar Fordragon\
Location: Stormwind Keep\
Level: 54\
Notes: You are asked to take another letter back to Magistrate Solomon in the Lakeshire Town Hall.\
\
5.) Quest Name: The True Masters (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4223)\
Start: Magistrate Solomon\
Location: Lakeshire Town Hall\
Level: 54\
Notes: Magistrate Solomon tells you to return to Morgan's Vigil in the Burning Steppes and to talk to Marshal Maxwell.\
\
6.) Quest Name: The True Masters (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4224)\
Start: Marshal Maxwell\
Location: Burning Steppes\
Level: 54\
Notes: Marshal Maxwell tells you to find and speak to someone named Ragged John in the Burning Steppes. He is located almost directly North of Morgan's Vigil near a cave at the top of the map.\
\
7.) Quest Name: Marshal Windsor (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4241)\
Start: Marshal Maxwell\
Location: Burning Steppes\
Level: 54 elite\
Notes: This is where things start to get harder. You can start this at level 54, but I would not advise it until closer to level 60. Take a full group. You will be heading into Blackrock Depths for this. Marshal Windsor is located in one of the cells towards the right side of the entrance to the instance.\
\
8.) Quest Name: Abandoned Hope (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4242)\
Start: Marshal Windsor\
Location: Blackrock Depths\
Level: 54 elite\
Notes: Again, take a full group of five. The more level 60's you have the easier this will be. Once you talk to Marshal Windsor, he tells you to leave him and talk to Marshal Maxwell again. So it's back to the Burning Steppes for you.\
\
9.) Quest Name: A Crumpled Up Note (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4264)\
Start: Crumpled Up Note\
Location: Blackrock Depths\
Level: 54 elite\
Notes: After you talk to Marshal Maxwell, the chain seems to end. You must go back to Blackrock depths and kill enemies until one of them drops the crumpled note. It is a random drop, but luckily does not seem to take long to get. When you do find it, you must take it to Marshal Windsor, who is still sitting in his jail cell in Blackrock Depths.\
\
10.) Quest Name: A Shred of Hope (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4282)\
Start: Marshal Windsor\
Location: Blackrock Depths\
Level: 58 elite\
Notes: Marshal Windsor asks you to find his lost information. There are two pieces, they are dropped by General Angerforge and Golem Lord Argelmach.",
    "6502349741034972006/11/11 22:48:17ollitrop11.) Quest Name: Jail Break! (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4322)\
Start: Marshal Windsor\
Location: Blackrock Depths\
Level: 58 elite\
Notes: This is the infamous escort quest that you have probably heard about at some point in guild chat or in your travels. This quest is actually extremely easy to do, provided you take the right precautions. Before ANYONE accepts the Jail Break! quest from Marshal Windsor, you must clear the path that he will be walking to retrieve his gear. There are two main areas you must clear, the first being the ring in which his cell is located, the other being the Ring of the Law. Make sure you clear out the cells along the way as well. Marshal Windsor gives off an aura that inceases attack speed, not everyone in the party will get it, it is broken so don't worry about it. Even if you clear out the path, there will still be enemies that spawn to attack you. Make sure your tanks are on their toes, you don't want Marshal Windsor dying and he is a pretty weak guy at this point in time. And no you cannot heal him during the fights, he will refill by himself after each one is over. After you are done, go back to\
Morgan's Vigil in the Burning Steppes and talk to Marshal Maxwell.\
\
12.) Quest Name: Stormwind Rendezvous (raid) (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=6402)\
Start: Marshal Maxwell\
Location: Burning Steppes\
Level: 63 elite\
Notes: Head to the gates of Stormwind. You may have to wait a few seconds for Marshal Windsor to spawn at the gates, once he does, talk to him to continue the quest chain.\
\
13.) Quest Name: The Great Masquerade (raid) (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=6403)\
Start: Marshal Windsor\
Location: Stormwind gates\
Level: 63 elite\
Notes: You will now have to follow Marshal Windsor through Stormwind, talk to him to start the quest. He will stop to talk to General Marcus Johnathan, just let him yap and eventually you will be told to follow him to the keep. When you get to the gates of the keep, he will stop and tell you to give him the signal when you are ready. Just click him again and you will have to follow him into the keep. When you get to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon, you listen to some arguement and then Lady Onyxia will spawn. At this point, if you are melee get the hell out of the way and DO NOT try and help Bolvar. He will be fighting a bunch of level 62 elites. When I did it, a crit of 1300 damage didn't even budge one of their HP bars. Bolvar will be taking them down, you can do this with just one ranged class helping. Myself and a warrior did it after the buff the dragons got in the patch, I attacked whatever one Bolvar was, and the warrior just watched.\
\
14.) Quest Name: The Dragons Eye (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=6501)\
Start: Highlord Bolvar Fordragon\
Location: Stormwind Keep\
Level: 63 elite\
Notes: Bolvar will give you a medallion, take it to Winterspring. You must find an NPC named Haleh. He is in a cave to the south/middle of the Winterspring map. The cave is full of elite drgaons and dragonkin. So either take a group, or get naked and start corpse running. At the back of the cave is a blue glowy thing on the ground. Step on it to get teleported to Haleh.\
\
15.) Quest Name: Drakefire Amulet (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=6502)\
Start: Haleh\
Location: Winterspring\
Level: 63 elite\
Notes: Haleh tells you to retreive the Blood of the Black Dragon champion from General Drakkisath. This means you have to go to Upper Blackrock Spire. This will take a raid group of 15 people. The General drops anywhere from two to four blood per run now, so you won't have to deal with the nightmare of endless runs to get your one blood like I did. Once you do, return to Haleh and he will give you your key to Onyxia. Congratulations! Now you can join other players in attempting to kill her!\

    "6502941823094182006/12/07 19:18:38Duelicion15.) Quest Name: Drakefire Amulet\
\
Hunters quick leason here on kiting. Which you will be asked to do here. Genreal Drakkisath has 2 mobs with him which are usually taken by the 2 warriors or whatever you have in the group. The big thing for you is getting the general as far away from the group as possible. What you need to do is put on aspect of the cheetah and get just in range of the general. \
   When everyone is ready it is really simple shoot drak and run like crazy to the beasts room. Drak should follow you and with aspect of the cheetah on he should not catch you.\
   When you reach the beast room run him along the walls til he is in your range again. Once he is in your range again that means you are in his. Simply fiegn death and lose aggro. By now your group should be done with drak's mobs and ready for him. If not you can start the whole thing over as long as you are over the bridge. You might die the second time depended on how much cooldown you have left on fiegn death.\
  One big thing to remember is that when entering the beasts room there is some fire. Make sure to JUMP over the fire or you will be dazed and probably die from the general.\
   That is the jist of kiting Drak and I hope it helps. It isn't as hard as everyone thinks it is but for the most part it is needed.",

\
When this quest was first available, all the way to the release of AQ40, there were no replacements for the Devilsaur Eye, and any hunter who took the spear found it quickly replaced, and any hunter who took the Devilsaur Tooth quickly found that it was useless in raids, and nominal in PvP.  However, with the release of AQ40, Naxx, and the expansion, there are several replacements for the Devilsaur Eye.  Examples being: Badge of the Swarmguard, Drake Fang Talisman, Jom Gabber, Kiss of the Spider and Slayer's Crest.  Even outside of raids, the Earthstrike trinket from the Cenarian Circle replaces the Devilsaur Eye.\
\
However, nothing in the game replaces the Devilsaur Tooth.  So, if you are a hunter that has not yet chosen your reward, it is probably in your best interest to get the Devilsaur Tooth.  Even in the expansion, there is not a replacement for this item.",
    "8232337329033732006/11/10 15:21:24glassthorneWhen it comes to your reward choices there are a couple of things to consider.\
\
In my opinion, the Hunting Spear is probably the least useful of the three items.  Weapons themselves will eventually become outdated, to begin with, as people level up, especially with the upcoming expansion.  Also, if one truly wants a decent spear, many hunters go and get the Ice Barbed Spear  (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=19106) which is a reward if you win ONE battle in Alterac Valley.  This spear has better overall stats, in my opinion, than the Hunting Spear, as it has an abundance of agility as well as stamina.\
\
This brings it down to the last two items.  Now if you are a Marks or Surv hunter, the Devilsaur Eye is clearly the best choice for you.  However, I'm not certain if there are other trinkets more useful than this for Marks/Surv hunters, so please make a comment if you believe there is.\
\
Being a BM hunter, I instinctively went for the Devilsaur Tooth.  I have no doubt in my mind that this trinket is one of the best for hunters with this spec.  It's highly useful for opening attacks, especially if one has a cat.  A cat put into Prowl, with the Devilsaur Tooth buff, as well as triggering Bestial Wrath the moment before it reaches the intended target means a strong critical opening attack that will proc Frenzy instantly.\
\
This will become especially useful when the expansion pack is released.  One of the new BM abilities is Ferocious Inspiration.  It means that when your pet scores a critical hit, all party members have their damage output increased by 1-3% for 10 seconds.",
    "8232189886111505002007/11/23 09:58:04exsanguinatorThe eye is definitely the choice to go with. As well as the above statement about the tooth being an extra crit that you don't really, the spear is also no good because  you should have gotten Grimlok's Charge (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=9416) from Uldaman a few levels ago anyway.",
    "82322591240259122007/01/27 18:24:36jerichoIs this still the truth with BC out now?  I know there are two seperate better trinkets than the eye you can get in Outland.  Bladefist's Breath and Mark of Conquest.  Both easy to obtain.  I realise that they are 8 and 10 levels higher than the eye you obtain here.  But does this effect the need for the eye over the tooth?  There still is no trinket I know of that enhances Pet crit rate in BC.",

    "82321505001401505002007/09/08 00:22:10zhekI think there's too many arguments that exist on the premise of an item being \"irreplaceable\". It's said also for the warlock quest, with one trinket being pretty much unique and the other two items being eventually replaceable. But that trinket is a 30 minute cooldown free void walker. My problem with taking the \"irreplaceable\" trinket is that odds are you're not going to wear the thing at higher levels even if you can't replace it. What it does simply isn't special enough to matter.\
\
In this case we have the Eye versus the Tooth. The polearm is pretty bad, nice crit, but while leveling your crit isn't terribly high to begin with. Greens at least increase your AP while they're at it. The Tooth gives a free crit on your pet's next attack. Now, if you're MM, or Survival, this doesn't really matter, your pet isn't a huge amount of your DPS and a crit other then the minor extra damage (especially if it's a claw or bite rather then a melee swing) is tiny. But if you're BM, you're looking at Ferocious Inspiration and Frenzy both procing every crit.\
\
The problem exists that your pet simply can maintain both up a ridiculously large amount of the time without the trinket. Particularly after the first crit, frenzy helps increase the odds he'll proc before the effect is over and refresh the duration. With cobra reflexes, serpent's swiftness, and frenzy, your pet attacks slightly more then once a second (.99 per second). Combined with a focus dump like Claw, and he doesn't need the crit from the Tooth.\
\
I think the Eye is more beneficial while leveling. And odds are if you're looking this up you are doing that. The eye gives a solid benefit and while it's not unique, the fact of the matter is you probably won't be using the Tooth in Outland anyway. You'll end up replacing either trinket but the Eye is a better damage increaser then offering a free crit to a pet that crits all the time anyway.",
    "8232152567611505002007/09/13 16:11:10ElsirI just wanted to say that I completely agree with zhek's opinion on this.  I have levelled a lock to 70 and took the voidwalker trinket on the reasoning that it was irreplaceable.  Guess what?  I never used it, because it sucks.  The devilsaur tooth sucks even more.  You will never equip it at level 70, and either of the other quest rewards are superior for levelling.  It's much better to have an item that will help you for 8-10 levels than one which will never help you, ever.  I am currently levelling a hunter and I plan on taking the trinket.  As a BM-spec hunter, it will stack nicely with BW, TBW, Rapid Fire, and Blood Fury for some insane burst damage!  The spear is a good choice as well if you aren't taking the IBS from the AV quest.",

I could be trying in vain for literally weeks on my server to get a group to run these.\
\
These questlines are brutal.  It's much easier to just farm approximately the same amount of gold (350 in fees + how much in mats?) for a \"normal\" epic mount. \
\
Anyone (myself included, before I rolled a pally) who thinks paladins get it easier than the other classes is mistaken.  Getting an epic charger is a challenge.",
    "7641177141017712006/10/11 14:20:27CreeestopherPaladin Epic Mount Questline:\
\
Step 1:  The Paladin trainer in the Cathedral in SW gives you 2 quest lines to complete:\
--\
Step 2A: Emphasis on Sacrifice  (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7637) (Priest in IF)\
Just need to fork over 150 gold.  (And you thought Paladins got free mounts)\
\
Step 3A: To Show Due Judgment  (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7639)\
Take the Censer back to Grayson.\
\
Step 4A: Exorcising Terrordale  (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7640)\
Head to Terrordale in the NW part of the Eastern Plaguelands.  Stand in the green circles and push use your Censer.  Kill 25 of these dudes and head back to Grayson.\
--\
Step 2B:  The Work of Grimand Elmore (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7641)\
Head to the Dwarven District in SW and talk to him.\
\
Step 3B:  A Collection of Goods (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7642)\
You need to pick up a lot of mats for this step, and another 150 gold.\
\
- 5 Stratholme Holy Water (From the crates in Stratholme)\
- 10 Arthas Tears (Pick em if youre an Herbalist, otherwise get them from the AH)\
- 40 Runecloth (drops, AH)\
- 6 Arcanite Bar (AH)\
\
Once you round these up, head back to Grimand and shell out your 150 gold.  Then head back to Grayson to get the next step.\
\
Step 4B:   Manna-Enriched Horse Feed (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7645)\
You need to be friendly with the Argent Dawn.  Buy 20 manna biscuits from them and head to the horse trainer in Southshore.  Give the horse trainer the biscuits and 50 gold and youre good to go.  Once again, head back to Grayson.\
--\
Step 5:  Ancient Equine Spirit (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7643) \
Head to Dire Maul to find an ancient spirit of a horse.  In Dire Maul west there is a treant, Tendris Warpwood, that you need to kill.  Once you kill him, the spirit of the horse will come out and you can talk to it.\
\
Step 6:  Blessed Arcanite Barding (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7644)\
Talk to the horse, it will bless your barding.  Once youve done this, head back to Grayson.  Before you do so, pick up an Azerothian Diamond and a Pristine Black Diamond (both from AH)\
\
Step 7:   The Divination Scryer (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7646)\
Give the diamonds to Grayson and hell give you the scryer.  Make sure you have the blessed barding with you when you do this.  Hell give you a satchel that has the scryer and the barding in it.\
\
Step 8:   Judgment and Redemption (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7647)\
Take the satchel and a group to Scholomance and work you way to Rattlegores room. \
\
A quick note about groups.  A priest will be very necessary so that you can shackle.  The more pallies you have, the better.  Id recommend 3 so that you can alternate judgments.  A warlock would be nice for soulstone and overall dps, but if youre not worried about dying, you could throw in a mage or a rogue.  But for the final battle, paladins are more important than others.\
\
Clear Rattlegores room and have everyone stand in the corner to the right of the door.  One of the pallies needs to run to the opposite corner (as close as they can get) and place the scryer on the floor.  Once the scryer is down, the event begins.  It is important to stay as far in the corner as you can so that you can rest at points in the event.\
\
The key to the event is using judgments.  Each wave needs a different judgment.  Judging the correct spell on each wave provides you with an AoE shock on the ghosts.  The more paladins you have, the more often you can have the mobs stunned and the better off youll be.  Set up a judging order and make sure everyone knows the order.  Have the 1st pally judge the correct spell and then count to 5 and have the next pally judge.\
\
The order is Wisdom, Justice, Righteousness, and finally Light.  When you get down to the last ghost in the last wave, have the priest shackle it and have everyone mana up because once the last ghost is down, the charger boss shows up.  \
\
Kill him and youve got a shiny new epic mount!",

If you want to play it safe, you may want to ride further south away from town towards some of the higher level scorpid spawn.\

A good place to farm Dragonscales are in the Badlands, by where all the dragons patrol. I think it's the fastest way to get them besides having to buy them in the Auction House.",

36x Thick leather\
40x Scorpid scale\

                                                 place.   3.1% drop\
\
Worn Dragonscale can you farm in Dustwallow Marsh 2.9-4.6. some rar spawn and elite whit higher drop rate. level 41-45.\
\
You can also get it in Swamp of Sorrow. level 41-45 drop rate is 4.5-5.5   <---best drop rate.\
\
Or you can go into Sunken Tempel and skinn the dragons there. they are elite so you need a party 48/49-55+ instace.\
\
Scorpid Scale: You can farm in Uldaman or Tanaris they have all 39.60 to 39.90 drop rate. the 46-47 scorpids in tanaris can drop from 1-2 and same in Uldaman.\
\
Thick Leather: I think you got it from before. But if you need it there shall be no problem, you gonna get it while skinning the other Mobs.\

    "44921779632117272007/11/02 03:51:05TheBadManThis was an excellent comment. Having just done the quest, I would like to add:\
*The little brat is lvl 54, but too cheap to buy a mount, so don't bother with your own. If he falls too far behind, you lose.\
*His cave is visable on your map in the south-eastern corner of Fire Plume Ridge, and if your not a terrible climber you can get at it from the south without drawing any agro.\
*He will say something once or twice before he drops, but before he actually falls over he will stop following you for a second and wander in a random direction, so just left click and glance behind you whenever he complains.\
*I suggest watching the little guy and walking backwards over the ledges on your way down, as the canteen has a very short range, and climbing back up the mountain is annoying.\
*Pick this up on your way back from Alien Ecology http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=3883 to keep your little vacation in Jurassic Park as short as possible.",
    "4492172775017272006/10/10 16:38:55pinktoqueRingo can be found initially in a small cave on Fire Plume Ridge at location 51, 50 to complete the quest to \"find\" him.  Once you find him, he'll give you a new quest \"A Little Help From My Friends\" and you escort him back to Marshal's Refuge. \
\
The escort part isn't tough because you lead Ringo, and so you can avoid mobs on your walk back (and you have like 22 minutes to do it.) You have a little canteen of water in your inventory that you were given from Spraggle when you were sent out to find Ringo, called \"Spraggle's Canteen\"- watch for Ringo to say things like \"Ugghhh\" or \"I'm feeling faint\" ... those are indications that he is about to faint, and will need to be revived with the water from the little canteen in order to proceed. \
\
I put the canteen in an empty slot in my hotbar for the duration of this quest.  I kept Ringo targeted; when he faints, you lose him as a target, so even if I missed his cues like \"uggh ... the heat, it's getting to me...\", as soon as I noticed I'd lost him as a target I knew I needed to revive him.  Simply click on him and then click the canteen in order to give him some water and revive him.  \

\
1.) Go to Molten Core and get the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=18703]Ancient Petrified Leaf[/url] from [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?object=179703]Cache of the Firelord[/url].\
2.) Right click the leaf to start [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7632]The Ancient Leaf[/url] quest.\
3.) Turn the quest in at [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=14524]Vartrus the Ancient[/url] in Felwood.\
4.) Now speak with [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=14526]Hastat the Ancient[/url] (he's right next to Vartrus the Ancient) and get the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=7634]Ancient Sinew Wrapped Lamina[/url] quest.\
5.) Go to Azshara and kill [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=6109]Azuregos[/url].\
6.) Loot [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=18704]Mature Blue Dragon Sinew[/url] from Azuregos.\
7.) Return to Hastat the Ancient with the Mature Blue Dragon Sinew to finish the quest. Upon completion you will recieve the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=18714]Ancient Sinew Wrapped Lamina[/url] quiver.\

Clear it and place the divination scryer in the NW corner but still on the mound (which rattlegore stand on). Tell your party to stand in the SE corner before you start.\
As soon as you place the scryer ghosts spawn but they are easy to kill so just run to the other players and kill the ghosts. You can judge seal of wisdom (I used the highest rank on all seals and it worked just fine) to stun them for a few seconds. Also works on the aspect. Second wave isn't too hard either, few elites but can be pulled one and one. Judge seal of justice to stun spirits and the aspect. Third wave is three groups of three elites. Do NOT pull the middle group first. Start with the group by the door and take the middle group last. When you pull the middle group all remaining groups will aggro. Remember to judge seal of righteousness on both spirits and aspect.\
\
Might be useful to put the shadow res aura on for the last wave. The last wave was easy too, few elites spawn every now and then. We had to wait a while betweent the spawns. Good time to rest and drink/eat. Use seal of light on spirits and the aspect. When the aspect is killed the boss will spawn. He's easy to kill.\
Loot the boss, use the charger's lost soul to get the charger's redeemed soul and hand in the quest :)\

Did it with a 70 hunter, 70 mage, 70 shadow priest, 69 rogue and me, 61 pally. Its really easy when you figure it out and do it right, hope some of you won't have to do the same mistakes we did. If you wipe, abandon the quest, go back to your trainer and take it again. Reset the instance and do it all over again. We couldn't find any other way to finish it.\
\
Good luck!",

My party composition was a 57 warlock, 58 hunter, 60 mage, 60 priest (very well geared, renews were ticking for 406) and myself, a level 62 protection spec paladin. no one in the group came close to dying, except on the miniboss for each wave where i hit 50%. sure we had to mana up a little after the wave with all the shadow bolts, but other than that, piece of cake. I'm sure that the quest can be completed *without* the correct judgements but it does make it alot easier - atleast in my group",

Also, on the last wave they come on a timer, even if you have one shackled.  We had a shackle up when the final boss came.  Best to just dps them down as fast as you can so you have one at a time.  Completed with 3 people.  A 70 lock, 64 Shadow Priest and 62 Holy Paladin.  Pretty easy overall.",

\
Also nice to know that multiple paladins can do the quest at once.\
\
A nifty tactic (if you have a priest) is to shackle one of the mobs in each wave. Kill everything else but the shackled one and it gives you a breather. We managed to keep the group up at almost full life/mana this way.\

Alternatively, a paladin could try and keep one perma-feared. That may work too.",

    "7647204143202041432007/12/19 21:00:02AldashinI just two-boxed this easily with a 60 Holy Paladin and a 70 Arms Warrior after failing in my first attempt. In addition to the advice given so far, here are a few tips that may help if you run it with a similarly minimalist crew.\
\
1) The first 3 waves are cake, even more so if you have anything that can lower the melee damage of the spirits (like Demo Shout). You can safely run Ret Aura for most if not all of these first 3 waves.\
\
2) The 4th wave is when it can get a bit tricky if you're unprepared - the mobs will lob a lot of  Shadowbolts and Shadowbolt Volleys. Shadow Protection Potions will essentially trivialize the rest of the event, so feel free to bring some if you're running with a light crew. The final boss (Death Knight Darkreaver) will go spam-happy with shadowbolts, but they're much more manageable than the 4th wave.\
\
3) Darkreaver's Mind Control *may* be ranged-based. My paladin was MCed early on when she was standing 10 feet from the DK. I moved her to max healing range after the first MC and was untouched the rest of the fight.\
\
I had to place the Scryer in the middle of the room to start the event. Still, standing in one of the corners by the entrance can help provide some downtime when needed.",

\
The sword is nice with all its resistances and bonus to healing, but it is a 2 handed sword. Thus its uses becomes limited as there are plenty of off-hands in the game that suite a paladin just nice. That, and 2 handed weapons are most likely for DPS paladins and then the bonus to healing becomes next to useless.\
\
As for the ring, it can be replaced quite rapidly at lvl 60. Both\
Fordring's Seal ( http://www.wowhead.com/?item=16058 )\
Songstone of Ironforge ( http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12543 )\
are equally good if not better. And both are quest rewards aswell.\
\
As for the trinket, 2 competitors at that slot are\
Royal Seal of the Eldre'Thalas ( http://www.wowhead.com/?item=18472 )\
Blackhand Breadth ( http://www.wowhead.com/?item=13965 )\
The first one is definitly a healing trinket, as where the 2nd one is a dps trinket. Sanctified Orb can be both.\

The sword is good yes, but can be replaced soon, the ring is also worse then the trinket in its own. As a Retadin why would you want +healing? You can get much better rings, such as Mason's Fraternity Ring and later on Painweaver Band, and the infamous Don Julio's Band.

\
You can stand (at 59, anyhow) right near the entrance inside of the Live side, and not get aggro from the first pull ofr level 55-56 skeletons. If you look forward, you can see where the wall for the gates stop and the hallway begins. This is where you want to be. Be careful about running too far ahead, because the gates for the entrance close down behind you, and the only way out is hearthing (or dying). \
\
Be careful, because if you don't tag the mob immediately with the blaster when they're in range, they might walk out of range before the 2.5 seconds of channeling that's required elapses. You can stop some of them with /dance, but(!) they will not allow you to tag them with the blaster, while they're dancing, so it's kind of pointless. \
\
The mob will run at you, and maybe get in a hit before it \"explodes\" into often one, but I've gotten up to four, wisps that are Restless Spirits. \
\
These spirits will flicker around pretty wildly, and you have to tag them again with the blaster to get credit. The channeling effect will make it so that you will always be pointing at the spirit, so you don't have to manually try to keep it in front of you. \
\
Timing from my chat log, the Spectral Citizens show up roughly 8-9 minutes apart, so assuming you only get one wisp per pull, that's 2 hours of sitting at the entrance. I managed to get all mine in just over an hour, though (one pull had 3, another had 4 wisps).",

You need to use the egg in the room where the skeleton of the avatar is in order to start the encounter, and then the mobs start spawning. Unless it was meant that you need to clear all the mobs around the area. \
\
This encounter is VERY hectic if you aren't well organized, so make sure you brief everyone before using the egg. \
Change the loot to free for all(thanks to the second post) and make sure one person is in charge of getting the blood and extinguishing the torches. The blood drops from wyvern looking creatures called Hakkari Bloodkeepers(http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=8438) that spawn one at a time. there are also several non elite venom spitters running around, that will quickly target your priest/healer, so have at least one person assigned to pull these off of them. Also, during the encounter before Hakkar is summoned by putting out the four torches, there are elite dragonkin called Nightmare Suppressor's (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=8497#00Rzc) that spawn and try to prevent you from summoning the avatar, they also start a \"drain soul\" like animation on the Avatar, but I didn't really notice if it was doing anything with all the other mobs around, sorry. But if you see them doing the drain, a quick attack is all that is needed to break the action and have them target you, then it is just a regular elite fight. \
One last thing, make sure everyone is ready and aware before the person with the blood goes to put the last torch out, because as soon as it is extinguished, the once ghost-form of the avatar hovering in the center of the room comes to life and starts pounding on the nearest target, so make sure your healer/ mages, or any other cloth wearers are well back.  And this also gives you a chance to change the loot back to group loot before having to face the big guy (something I wish I had done) He drops some nice Rare BoP items, and it is kind of a bummer to have someone accidentally loot it without realizing it is still on free for all.  Good luck and hope this makes the encounter a little easier for anyone else.",

For this quest you have to ride up to Zul'Mashar. You will easily find the path as it's full of troll scouts, around level 57 mobs. They have some drain life ability, they enrage and it gets harder and harder as you try to reach the top. You will find the mobs hard to kill as the cannibals are level 58-59 so you might as well can kamikaze, stealth or run in and die safely to corpse run. They also call for help so if you think you were safe, think again! You can get hexed, shot at, almost anything.\
\
Inspector Hameya (71,16 or so) is a level 60 Humanoid that patrols around the graveyard - you can easily pull him solo but chances are you will also pull a mossflayer along with him so be careful. He doesn't do a lot of damage so he's fairly easy at level 58.\

After you loot the key from him, run back to The Undercroft (28,86) and complete your quest on the mound of dirt in the back of the mausoleum, right next to a broken cart. There you go, rewards are crap but you might want to keep a cloak in case you need some extra arcane resistance!",

I had to clear it again ._.\
\
Overall if you're a warlock, get felguard and it should be a piece of cake. Banish the level 54 succubus, focus fire on the shadow lord, then kill the level 54 succubus after shes got out of her banish then clear the level 52 succubus.

If you have any spell interrupt abilities, use them as he starts to cast.  He didn't seem to have much health.  The two succubi only used melee attacks the entire fight, so with some quick healing and focusing on one at a time, they went down as fast as their lord.\
\
Another note:  they are not at the very back of Shadow Hold.  Lord Banehollow, a level 59 elite demon, is at the very back.  These three spawn earlier, in front of a two-sided ramp that leads into a larger area.  We missed them the first time around because another party doing one leg of the Warlock epic mount quest had swept through earlier and the three mobs had not respawned.  We looked around until we found Lord Banehollow, then started backtracking.  By the time we came back to the ramp, the three mobs we needed had respawned (along with everything else nearby).  Had we known to stay in that room, we could have had an even easier time of it, killing each mob as it spawned, rather than taking all three at once.",

    "5242114468401144682007/07/02 13:49:36GilgadeanHere's how I went about this relatively simple, time consuming but rewarding quest:\
\
Make sure you have this and the quest to gather Trey's remains (You need to free the night elf from the cage from a random key drop. All the braziers can be extinguished during the run to get her gear, plus she can do some mild damage to any mobs giving you trouble. Once you've freed her and put out the fires, you'll get the two quests.)\
\
At level 57, Shadow Hold is a push-over. Almost every mob, except for the larger Demons, are green. If you're a melee class, you'll cut through these guys like butter. Casters might want to take it slow and make sure your mana is full enough, and rogues or druids (cat form) can most likely stealth to the very bottom.\
\
Start by clearing down to the place where the night elf captive found her gear. There will be five or so ooze creatures seperating the second half of the \"dungeon\". They are immune to nature damage, so druids and shamans (like I was) take caution.\
\
After the ooze, you'll find more of the same casters and sword/shield mobs you fought earlier. If you can, hug the right wall and attack anything that attacks you. Otherwise, just slice through them until you reach a narrow tunnel. \
\
Inside here you'll find the Succubus you need to kill for the Trey's remains quest. She can be pulled alone, and when she dies, a yellow ? will appear above the naked human on the altar. Pull the 4 casters, kill them and finish that quest. \
\
Continue along down the route and a couple of mobs later you'll end up at Fel'dan and his guards. Clear the mobs nearby, and focus your efforts on Fel'dan. He should fall very easy if he's of yellow quest coloring to you. The two Succubus guards hit slow and not very hard at that. They cast a mind control spell, so be careful. They're levels 52 and 54, posing very little threat. Kill them, loot the head off Fel'dan, and either hearth out or start cutting your way back through. (I tried to just run out. ...didn't work.)\

I will admit my gear is somewhat twinked, but nothing too outrageous. 3,480 health in Dire Bear Form, 24% crit.\
\
Start in caster form, Entangling Root, Moonfire. Recast Roots when the timer is almost up, and repeat this until he's maybe at 85-90%. After that just wait out until Roots is almost up, cast Regrowth and Rejuv on your and pop Bear Form tossing a (Feral) Faerie Fire on him (don't Enrage).\
\
Demoralize him as soon as you can. Bash him right after, and begin Mauling. When YOU are at about half health gather up about 30-40 Rage and hit your Enrage + Frenzied Regeneration. Auto-swing until it's over. Then start the mauling again.\
\
After that just make sure you keep blowing your CDs (Bash and Enrage primarily), and always keep Demoralizing Roar and Faerie Fire on him. If it starts getting close at the end, you can always pop out, root him, run out of melee, and heal. And if you're Tauren, of course War Stomp first thing when you pop out. ;]\

Gorlash is a level 47 elite giant, so come prepared.  Two shamans (mid to late 40s) did this with no problems.  Probably a good idea to bring some healing.  Total time from getting quest, finding and killing Gorlash, then returning is maybe ten minutes.",

This one is probably one of the easier quests around that level range; you start at the house near the dock in the village by the Darnassus portal, you go to Winterspring and pick up ten easy-to-get feathers anywhere in the zone, you go back to the village, then back to Winterspring for an escort quest where there are no random spawns and you fight one mob at a time, then go back to the village again, and into Darnassus to finish.\
\
While doing this escort, like an above poster mentioned, do the Enraged Wildkin quest chain that starts in Starfall Village. To the west of this escort quest, there's a camp with two objects to pick up, and you don't have to kill more than two or three oomkins to get them, then you just kill the oomkins that you were going to kill anyway while doing this escort for the amulet.\

\
I used nightscape boots to help with the stealth, I highly recommend them for this trip. Also, you'll want to have 300 lockpicking (though I don't know if you need it at 300, that's what I had) \
\
From the entrance, go straight between the two guards and into the courtyard. Be very careful, there are patrols with dogs doing circles. The guards won't see you, but if you're not careful the dogs will. The place you want to head is at your 2 o'clock position. As you get closer, you'll see the little jail cages suspended from chains. \
\
Follow the corrodor, avoiding dogs and patrols. Your minimap will show Windsor up as the little yellow dot we've all come to know and love. It should lead you to a cell that is guarded by three dwarves and a dog. \
\
Here's the tricky part. You have to get rid of the guards to pick the lock on the door to get to Windsor. The way I did it was to sap one of the guards, kill the dog and vanish. Wait for cooldowns, sap a guard, kill the other two guards (thank you blade flurry) and vanish again. Finally kill the last guard. The guards run, so use crippling poison. \
\
I had some epics in my gear which made life easier; I suspect though it could be managed with just blues, just brind blinding powder and maybe a healing potion or two. \
\
When you leave the instance, make sure you don't reset it. Once you turn in the quest, the chain will continue till you get the crumpled note. That note will mean another trip back to Windsor and since the respawn rate in BRD is very, very slow, if you do them quickly you will come back and find the guards still dead. \
\
Good luck!",

\
Though, Feral Druids sometimes are asked to main heal (I can attest that it is quite viable to do, from my own experience), so if one prefers not to get the Grizzled Pelt, the Forest's Embrace could be a good alternative.\
\
I agree with your evaluation of the items, though.",
    "9053166482411493342007/10/12 09:24:48dlwightAs a feral druid, I would have to disagree with you.  In the whole debate of strength vs agility for feral druids, I calculated that you generally want to maximize the sum of str + agi for max dps.  That being said, the grizzled pelt has a slight dps advantage at a sum of 33, while the mixologist's tunic is 29.  On the other hand, you get 70 more health with the mixologist's tunic from the extra stamina and 7 more armor, but the grizzled pelt has slightly more agility which also boosts your armor.  So in the end, I would argue that they are virtually identical for feral druids and since you will probably have to compete with your other party members for the mixologist's tunic, I would favor taking the Grizzled pelt now.",

For healing gear, the bonus to healing on the Forest's Embrace is godlike. You won't find anything even close until Outland, when you can get Sacred Feather Vest (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28050).\
\
If you're Balance, take the staff. The bonuses on it are very nice, and while you will replace it with Crystfire Staff (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24069) in Outland, it will easily last until then.\
\
If you're feral, DON'T take the Grizzled Pelt. Mixologist's Tunic (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12793), which drops in BRD, is much better. You'll be replacing the Pelt very quickly. Frankly I'd take the staff, as it sells for the most. >.<",

\
Be careful of mobs that travel a path. We learned that the hard way when a slime came around the corner unexpectedly. And there is an order to the statues that must be followed.\
\
Before activating the last statue, be sure nothing has re-spawned down below on the steps or in the water. If clear, activate the last statue click into cat form and jump down (softer landing) and try to not get punted by the mob that spawned. The punt won't kill you... the fall from being punted will.\

- She can be found in the deepest room of the cave, cave's entrance is at 54,88.\

-  She heals herself very often.  Her greater healing spell can heal her back to 100% hp with very little mana required, so if you intend to solo her, get ready for a very very long fight.  If you don't have any way to interrupt her healing, bring someone who can or better forget about this quest.\
\
I just solo'ed her as level 59 Blood Elf Retribution Paladin.  Even with 3 moves to interrupt her healing, the fight lasted around 5 minutes (she healed 10+ time) I had to use bubble, Lay on Hand and popped 2 Major mana potions during the entire fight.",

Even with clever usage of stuns when she was low hp and attempting to heal herself (war stomp and the bear stun) she would just stand there and keep trying until it landed.

When you complete this quest, she will woo her lover (Rocknot) and they will leave, opening the door in the BRD tavern. Subsequently, whenever you come to BRD, you can simply speak to the succubus to get her to do the same, hence giving you a free way to open the Phalanx guarded door.",

\
The dead end is naturally filled with mobs, and we found the Undead Courier there as well to kill him for the postbox keys. When you approach, the Great Fras Siabi himself shows up looking pretty ripe, and of course if you haven't cleared the area carefully and thoroughly first, you're in a position to get owned, which we almost did. Also don't screw around with the postbox until you're ready, as that spawns 3 elites too. After Fras is put down, everybody can loot the tobacco box for the win.\
\
The Lighter isn't all that--with the exception of the fact that it doesn't get you drunk, it's graphically and effect-similar to Thunderbrew's Boot Flask. Yet another novelty trinket taking up space in the bank.\
\
If you're 5-manning Scarlet Strath, you might as well do this one as the dead end isn't very much additional work once you've cleared the street to that point anyway. It's not in itself a reason to do Scarlet Strath in 5, as the quest ends there and doesn't follow on to my knowledge.

\
Soloed as a 54 Warlock.\
\
Servants of Grol are level 53-54:\
\
Two at Dreadmaul Hold 43,13(inside gate, outside cave)\
Surrounding Mobs are level 46-47.\
\
Enter the gate and attack to the right. The servant on the right side has 3 mobs next to his stone situated in the middle of the catapults on the left. The servant hides in the roots of the large tree past his stone with one mob standing next to him. Proceed around the back to the other side of the cave. The second servant's stone, situated just before the catapults on the left, has 4 mobs next to it. The servant hides next to the large tree past his stone on the right (you can't see him there if you enter the gate and attack to the left) with one mob near him.\
\
One in Dreadmaul Post 49,43\
Surrounding mobs are level 55-57.\
Over 10 mobs at entrance.\
\
I did as recommended above and waited for a respawn at Dreadmaul Hold rather than try to get in here.\
\
Servants of Sevine are level 56:\
\
Along the path to the Alter of Storms 39,32\
Surrounding mobs are level 53-55.\
3-5 mobs around the servant at base of path.\
1 mob near servant mid-way along path.\
1 mob near servant at top of path.\
\
Servants of Alistarj are level 55:\
\
Along the Eastern border from Serpent's Coil South\
65,32 \
Surrounding mobs are level 51-53.\
4 mobs near servant's crystal.\
\
64,40\
Surrounding mobs are level 52-53.\
2 mobs near servan'ts crystal.\
\
64,46\
Surrounding mobs are level 52-53.\
4 mobs around servant's crystal.\
\
I could not pull this servant's mobs individually due to their close proximity to the servant. This is the only place I died during this quest.\
\
Servants of Razelikh are level 57:\
\
Around the rim of the cliff near the Dark Portal 58,50\
Surrounding mobs are level 55 and rove in pairs.\
\
Watch the rovers movement path to determine best place to attack the servant at. Looking at the map, the 3rd servant from the right hand end has rovers that come very near his crystal.\
(Note: I have only been able to find 7 of the 9 so you may have to wait for two respawns.)",
    "268112036550120362006/12/09 08:45:55KarakenPosting for those of you who don't have UIs.\
\
The servants of Razelikh are found around the dark portal. Watch out for the Felguard patrol around the portal.\
\
Servants of Allistarj are all found along the eastern wall of the zone, stopping just before Nethergrade Keep.\
\
Servants of Servine are found along the wall north of the entrance to the tainted scar (which is the western wall)\
\
Servants of Grol are the most difficult to find, in my opinion. You can find one in a cave guarded by ogres in the mountain off the path to the tainted scar. Just follow the path until you begin travelling west, then go north and look for a lone mountain, Once you find ogres, you've found the one servant. The other place to find them are Grol's fort, located in the northwest corner of the zone. You'll know you found it because you'll see a tower and a base with horde banners. The servants are in there. To get there, go west along the northern wall from the entrance of the zone.\

A note that the servants will NOT die until you smash the crystal, and the stun effect on them wears off after around 30 seconds. If you're having trouble smashing the crystal, remember that you have to stun it (Drop around 85% of it's health) next to the crystal in order to smash it.\
\
For those who want coords, 49.7, 43.8 is where the lone Servant Of Grol is.The dark portal is around 58.8, 51.6. Frydebo provided coords to the other servents, as well as the Grol fort.\

I tried to do it just now and while the Grol, Allistarj and Sevine works just fine some of the Razelikh is bugged. When you get their health enough for the \"green glow\" to appear, you are still not able to use the stone next to some of them. I know for a fact that once I was to far away, but on at least four times on three different Razelikhs I was close enough for it to work. It didn't.\
\
However, on the west side of the portal I found two Razelikhs who wasn't bugged and since they are on a pretty short respawn timer I suggest you stay on that side and finish the quest. By the time I did the other three groups of servants and found these \"working\" Razelikh it was a bit late and I had to give up after I got 4/9 . I'll grab the remaining five tomorrow. There are a pair of demons patrolling that area on the west side plus a few boars and basilisks, but if you can handle the level 57 Razelikhs, they shouldn't be a problem. Good luck.",

That's link of map where I showed the locations. Don't try to find them inside any building or cave, all servants are outside.\

Also once, when a servant's hp dropped to %1 and he become immune to anything, the stone did not become breakable.. That's probably because I pulled him far off the stone so you better keep the servants and the stones close to each other.\

It depends greatly on your server's economy on which way is cheapest... Typically it's dense stone, but sometimes it's thorium bars.\
Here's a quick way to find out how much it's going to cost you per turnin:\
Multiply the cost of one stack (20) of each item by the number of stacks per turnin: 2 for rugged leather, 1.6 for dense stone, and for the widgets, .9 * Thorium Bars + .3 * Runecloth.\
Therefore, let's say that on your server, thorium bars cost 3g a stack, runecloth 1g, rugged leather 2g and dense stone 2g.\
That means each turn in costs 3g for thorium, 4g for leather, and 3.2g for stone. (for a total of 180g for 1200)\
Now you usually will end up using a combination, depending on what is on the AH at any given time, or your own farming skills, but this is a handy tool for those who plan on buying a majority of it.",

The ritual _either_ finishes on itself despite dying or we were so close we just wiped as it ended. We then continued the ritual and killed the dreadsteed and master.\

My point? Don't give up if you wipe. If you've got a soulstone up (which you should) and you wipe, wait it out for a few minutes and then pop up.\

\
DM West is rather easy for Warlocks due to their banish spell.  Having 2 'locks makes taking down the pylons very easy.\
\
Having 2 'locks around for enslave demon during the Xorothian Dreadsteed event is sometimes the edge you need to succeed.  Since the elite demons spawn at a certain rate during the event, it is possible to fall behind and then it becomes very diffictult to finish.   With a second 'lock handy it's no trouble to have 2 elite demons controlled and fighting one (or two if you're really behind in dps) elite demon(s). \
\
Plus two 'locks handing out healthstones and using soulstones makes for a fast rebound from a bad situation or wipe.\

Good luck.",

\
What you can do is offer ot take people in their high 50s through, but this means that both instances will still end up being a challenge as they are geared for people 59-60.  All of which are in outlands getting better xp and gear than you can offer.\

Banishing and AOE makes this much easier. This is why having multiple locks is a godsend.\
\
We ran this with 3 locks, tank, and priest. 2 locks were on banish and AOE patrol, and the last one did nothing but refresh artifacts.\
\
Also, you can have as many locks as you want complete the last phase of the quest by inviting them in the group to talk to the spirit. They just have to be on the last part of the chain. This was true as of a month or so after BC was released.",

\
I used this same hunter at 70 to help a 66 warlock get her mount, we had a full group composed of a 56 druid, 62 priest and 57 paladin.  While we completed the summoning ritual first time, it was still a bit hair raising because we lacked good aoe and the warlock had to spend her time refreshing the ritual components.\

I wouldn't say this are an easy quest, but with the right people in your party it becomes a bit easier. I've been trying some combinations of people in the party and I would say that with a druid/priest, 2 warlocks (to enslave the eleite demons that spawns during the event), a mage (who can aoe the imps, to keep them of the warlock who's restarting the bell, wheel and candle) and a warrior, this quest are easy and a wipe should be able to avoid.\

Since nobody has mentioned, I'll just say that the steed makes an awesome knockback, so try to stand with your back to a wall. If posible have one of the enslaved demons to tank the steed, since they can't be knockbacked.",

If you happen to bring 2 warlocks as others have said only one has to buy the summoning items.  However, keep in mind that if the other warlock just buys the black lodestone they can help to keep the bell, candle, and wheel active.  It isn't necessary but it can be helpful because when a warlock has any sort of aggro it will interrupt them from reactivating the items, not to mention sharing the shard costs is a big plus.",

    "763110450131270462007/06/14 20:55:39unitepunxI helped a few 56/60ish guildies run through DM:W a few days ago, mostly for the lock in our group to get the Dreadsteed. At the end we invited in 5 more locks in rotation who all spoke to the pony and received their dreadsteeds. So it seems that in reality, the who thing is pretty worthless, since you can just basically wait it out.\
\
Another lock in our guild said something similar as above, when he went though they had 2 locks both SS'd (one from an external member before they patched the guild SS cheat). They ended up wiping, and somewhere around 5 minutes into their death (still ready to res) everything despawned. They resed and completed it.\
\
Something to try: have a party member (lock) start the ritual with all armor in his/her bag, die and all other party members far away from the summoning circle, where they aren't flagged in combat. Wait the ritual out, and then run in afterwards. It may be neccesary to use a SS, so the dead lock can SS himself again, and die again in the middle since the ritual takes much longer than 6 minutes.",

    "76227015510701552007/04/20 15:52:05RaydawnOkay, first, I used only four spells. Holy Nova Rank 6 for the skellies, Flash Heal Rank 4, and Renew Ranks 9 and 6.\
\
The Peasants: You cannot use the \"V\" key to see their health bars. I tried this every which way. Instead, I use the AF Tool Tip mod. This brings the tooltip (with hp) to your mouse pointer, so you can scan across the wave of peasants and see their health without moving your eyes to the lower right corner. The gauntlet of skeletal archers tend to focus on 1-3 targets, and you can see their arrows sticking out so that helps you decide who to heal as well. Begin healing with Renew unless the peasant is very close to death. Use Renew 9 if they're getting beat up a lot/diseased, especially if they are members of a \"fresh\" wave. Use Rank 6 renew for \"stale\" peasants who are diseased or hurt. I used Flash Heal only if they were very low (followed up with a Renew 9) or if they were being fired out by lots of archers and diseased, etc. I think I used disease cure only twice out of nervousness, so I'm sure it's not very necessary. Use your best judgement once you get a feel for the event.\
\
The skeletons: I used Crystal Charge, made from the red and yellow power crystals in Un'Goro crater. I didn't use Oil of Immolation because I wasn't sure if they were on the same cooldown as Major Mana Potions, so I didn't risk it. When they are grouped up, a crystal charge or holy nova is great. When my cooldown for the Crystal Charge (1 min) was still going down, I was forced to use Holy Nova. I used Rank 6, but Rank 5 MIGHT work. Wanding is key. It took usually 1, sometimes 2 hits from my Bonecreeper Stylus (which is why I say that Holy Nova Rank 5 just might do enough damage). This works especially great if you can see a lone skelly running down to you and the overall health of the peasant wave is good and you can just wand him as he comes. Resists stink, and sometimes you have to let a skelly wail on you while you throw some renews around.\
\
Extras: I used 3-4 Major Mana Potions, I honestly can't remember. Use them early, so the cooldown ticks while you fight. I also used Lesser Mana Oil (8mp5) on my weapon. I'm sure some Nightfin Soup (8mp5) would be a big help as well. I didn't use Demonic or Dark Runes, but I'm sure those would help too.\

\
There are several methods that are available online for how to complete this quest, but let me say what worked for me:\
1) 60 Feral Druid in bear form at the cave entrance who was kind enough to go /afk there while he made dinner\
2) In order: Full rank renew on purples, abolish greens, ~half rank renew on injured.\
3) If your bear form druid friend is taking significant damage, through him a heal or full rank renew.\
\
When the skeletons attack you, there are significantly fewer arrows flying through the air. By leaving the bear at the entryway, he will pick up all of the skeletons and keep them for quite a while making keeping up the peasants significantly easier.\
\
Using this method, I blew 1 mana potion and the Mar'li's Eye. I was in all 5-man blues, except for 1 piece of prophecy and my wonderful green gloves (and Mar'li's Eye... and the friendly ring of the Bronze Dragonflight)",
    "76221670820167082006/12/18 02:29:06jsounds2010Few things that helped me complete the quest on my 1st try.\
\
1) Get tinytip: an addon that allows you to see the health bars when you scroll your mouse over the peasants.  For some reason you can'y use V, shift-V, or control-V to see the health bars anymore.  I've read Dev's posts that say the will address it in an upcoming patch, but they haven't yet.\
2) Oil of Immolation: there's no cooldown & with these the Skellies go down quick.\
3) Holy Nova rank 3: in case you run out of Oil of Im, but it drains much needed mana. Mana conservation was the toughest part for me\
4) Renew Rank 5, Flash heal Rank 4: You don't need full ranks for peasants they don't have much health\
5) Well placed PychScream: If you get overwhelmed by Skellies & you need mana for peasant heals\
6) Wand: Takes down single skellies in 1 hit usually\
7) Respawn of quest NPC, if you fail,  is much quicker now : used to be over an hour.  Now it's no more than 30mins.\
8) Net videos of the quest: found lots of great ones\
9) Cure 1st Heal 2nd: Make sure you cure the peasants 1st, then heal.  The diseases they get will wipe them out quick.\
10) Peasants will die:  Don't worry if you loose 1 or 2 in each group.     \
11) Have a couple mana potions & use the 1st one as soon as your mana is @ 50%: That way your cooldown will be up when/if you run out of mana\

    "7622127772132832006/12/10 13:45:59WailanerThis quest is now much easier with Holy Nova. If you decide to solo this and it is completely possible here are some hints. Use renew rank 3 on the peasants this will be enough health for them to reach safety and enough aggro for you to get the skeleton attention. When your shield gets eat'en up by the skeleton and you threw out your renews blow the skeletons away with Holy Nova. The skeletons do not have much HP.\
\
Only problem with soloing the event is the long reset time if you fail. Therefore it is nice to bring a couple friends. From what I understand the rules are the friends should stand on top of the quest giver and not move during the event and they are not to heal you. Have a mage and another healer the mage can AOE on top of you when the skeletons come and the addition healer can heal the mage. This way you can save all your mana for peasants.",

The priest that is only able to move is the one who started the quest.\

First of all, check out this map of the fountain location: http://www.wowhead.com/?object=759\

Now, head north from booty bay. You come to a wall of rock on your left, starting about the same level as the big island off the coast. As soon as you see the wall end, turn left. There will probably be a gorrilla or two there. \
\
Basically, you will walk uphill in a spiral. Hug the path to your left. You follow the wall until you come to a path heading left. Follow it accross the bridges and take the first path heading to the left, uphill. This is where the nagas show up. Watch the wall to your left, and you will see an arched entrance. Kill nagas and go straight across the rope bridge. \

at first i failed it when the 3 scorpions spawned around us...\
second time i failed because more mobs were wandering around this time...\
and third time i failed because of the 3 wastewanders that spawned around us after the scorpions...\
the fourth time i managed to complete it with hardly any mobs around.\
The trick to completing it for me was to kind of try and roughly remember the route that chicken takes, if you can do that then you can kill any mob around that area before taking on the quest - then you can easily escort it with no trouble. \
\
I did it with my lvl 50 Human Warrior, it was tricky even at that level...but another trick to doing it in one go especially as a warrior is to use intimidating shout for the 3 scorpions quickly kill one and if you have a good healing potion drink it and kill the other two...same applies to the 3 wastewander girls.\

2) Let the witchdoctor help you -- by meleeing gorillas and grabbing aggro.  It seems many people just barely miss completing the quest and the help the witchdoctor can add for each wave can easily be the difference between success and failure.

on the first wave try to kill as many monkeys as you can before you get low on health once you do run away and deaggro all the monkeys that are left they will run back and start attacking the witch doctor bandage/eat&drink while he fights them for a while (he can take quite a bit) once you get your hp/mana back up go back and kill the rest of the monkeys\
\
on the second wave stand back a bit and let him pick up the aggro on some right away kill what you can then run a bit then come back and kill the rest and bandage/eat&drink up before the final wave\
\
on the last wave stand back and let him aggro as many as possible get the aggro on mokk and kill him fast loot his heart and run (or kill the rest if you can/want to)\

Clear a path through them up to 35,61 (By then you should have obtained a Gorilla Fang) then talk to Witch Doctor Unbagwa. He won't have a yellow ? above his head for some reason, but is easy to find inside his cave. Once you speak to him, you will have a gap of about 10 seconds then a Enraged Silverback Gorilla (Level 43) will attack you. After him, another gap till Konda comes, another Level 43 Gorilla. Then you will have another gap till Mokk the Savage comes up (Level 44). Kill him and loot the Heart of Mokk. Return to Booty Bay and job done.\

\
For horde, the quest line to get this begins with a [b]Deathguard Tor[/b] (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=16003) located right outside the Undercity Zeppelin (Alternately, [b]Orok Deathbane[/b] (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=16007) in Ogrimmar outside the bank, and [b]Temma of the Wells[/b] (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=16008) in Thunderbluff.) . He will give you a card to give to [b]Elenia[/b] (Quest named: \"Dearest Elenia,\"). You give this to Elenia located around the UC bank (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=16004).\
\
This finishes this part of the quest line, and a quest giver ([b]Fenstad[/b] http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=16108) right next to her will have a quest (Quest named \"[b]Fenstad's Hunch[/b]\"). He sends you to [b]Apothecary Zinge[/b] (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=5204) located at the far back of the Apothecary District. She gives you the quest \"[b]Zinge's Assessment[/b]\", where you return to [b]Fenstad[/b]. Fenstad rewards you with a \"Box of Chocolates\" and a \"Handful of Rose Petals\".\
\
The next quest is \"[b]Tracing the Source[/b]\" (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8982), where he sends you to the Inn Keeper located on the top of the inner ring. [b]Inn Keeper Norman[/b] (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=6741) then sends you to [b]Mara Rennick[/b] (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=16109) located at the UC Tailoring Shop (the quest is also named \"[b]Tracing the Source[/b]\" http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8983).\
\
Finally, she gives you \"[b]The Source Revealed[/b]\" (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8984), where you're asked to find [b]Apothecary Staffron Lerent[/b] (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=16107). Lerent is located near Ravenhold Manor, which is in Hillsbrad. Once you're in the manor, head past the farm, (past the wall) up the hill, and down it, procede northeast until you see him.\
\
Turn in the quest, and MAKE SURE to click the cauldron nearby. The quest giver makes no indication of this, and this is how you get the reward. The cauldron gives a quest \"A Bubbling Cauldron\" (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=9029), and you get your choice of one of six vanity chest pieces, between red, blue, and purple \"Lovely Dress\" and the same colors for \"Dinner Suit\".\
\
The final part of this is identical for both factions, so other then the running around (I believe the quest has you running around Stormwind to much the same effect as Horde do in UC) you finish at the same spot. There typically seems to be people ganking due to the likelyhood of others showing up to get their reward, so watch out if you're on a PvP server, particularly since the cauldron isn't terribly obvious.\

    "9029135864111131592007/08/11 09:40:21zhekThere are only a limited number of body types (two, robe, and no robe) for each race. Additionally boots and gloves have a limited number of shapes they can be in (something like 3-4 each). All leggings/chest pieces are skin tight. The reason is most likely they want to keep at a minimum the number of models a player has to load. For those slots, there's a very small number of choices. For more visable pieces (the shoulders and head pieces) they can be unique, although many head pieces share fairly common shapes across armor types.\
\
It reduces dramatically the amount of unique models to be loaded by streamlining the more basic pieces, and allowing the more visible ones to be the special pieces, basically.",

You will have to work to get the 1200 tickets to get the item.  I have found that farming rugged leather and making rugged armor kits was a fast way to get tickets.  \
\
Here is a breakdown:\
\
8 rugged armor kits = 20 tickets.\
You'll need 480 rugged armor kits to get the required 1200 tickets.  It is completely obtainable with some work, and it is a great reward for the effort.",

Here's a quick way to find out how much it's going to cost you per turnin:\
Multiply the cost of one stack (20) of each item by the following: 2 for rugged leather, 1.6 for dense stone, and for the widgets, .9 * Thorium Bars + .3 * Runecloth.\
Therefore, let's say that on your server, thorium bars cost 3g a stack, runecloth 1g, rugged leather 2g and dense stone 2g.\
That means each turn in costs 3g for thorium, 4g for leather, and 3.2g for stone. (for a total of 180g for 1200)\
Now you usually will end up using a combination, depending on what is on the AH at any given time, or your own farming skills, but this is a handy tool for those who plan on buying a majority of it.",

\
[b]Note:[/b] In all of this, the auction house is your friend!\
\
You can gain a head start by solely handing in [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=5117]Vibrant Plumes[/url].

Now you require 900 more tickets. For maximum ticket gain, at 20 tickets per turn in, you have a choice of: 10 x [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=11404]Evil Bat Eyes[/url], 10 x [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=19933]Glowing Scorpid Blood[/url], 8 x [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12644]Dense Grinding Stones[/url], 6 x [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=15994]Thorium Widgets[/url] or 8 x [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=15564]Rugged Armor Kit[/url].\

    "55271468780146872006/12/13 06:28:02kreghxThe Dusty Reliquary is located in the lodge structure located at the top of the hill towards the north end of of the village. It's located in the SE corner of the building, so you'll be able to see it from the entrance. \
\
The village is populated by Tortured Druids (lvl 54-55) and Tortured Sentinels (lvl 56-57). These guys are all single pulls and don't have any special attacks. In the lodge, 1 druid guards the door, 2 sentinels are inside the lodge, and a 3rd sentinel stands out on the east balcony. The balcony sentinel is close enough to aggro when you open the reliquary, so you'll probably have to kill her, too. \
\
The mobs themselves aren't hard, but each one you kill a chance to spawn 1-3 wasps on death. I got no wasps about half the time and typically 1 the rest. I think out of ~20 kills, I may have pulled 2 wasps three times and 3 wasps once. The wasps hit harder than the spirit mobs, so it's nice to have a group for this. \
\
If you solo it (as I did as a level 58 mage), here are some tips that might save you a few fights. \
\
First, there appears to be shortcut into the village from the east side. The lodge balcony overlooks a cliff, but the outer stone wall has a broken path leading down to the valley floor. I did not walk all the way down it since there were sentinels I could aggro below and I'd already fought my way in from the main west entrance. However, I walked sufficiently far down that path that I think it likely that you could use to get up to the east side of the village. As such, it might be worth your while to circle the village until you get to the east side. \
\
When at the east side of the lodge, DO NOT attack the balcony sentinel if you're not on the balcony. She won't jump over the railing, but will instead run through the building and around the outside to get to you. In so doing, she'll aggro the other three mobs on the way, which makes for a lot of potential wasps. \
\
To attack her on the balcony, circle from the east side to the north side of the balcony. You can climb up the rock outcroppings to the north and then jump south onto a stone ledge (the top of the lodge's foundation) that runs around the edge of the building. From there you'll be able to run back around to the balcony and climb over the railing to attack the balcony sentinel. You then have to kill the sentinel closest to the balcony. With those two down, you can open the reliquary without agrroing the the sentinel at the west end of the building as well as the druid in the doorway. \
\
As a mage, here's a way to avoid the fight altogether. Jump up to the stone ledge. Run around to the balcony. You'll aggro the sentinel on the balcony. Run far enough inside to aggro the sentinel on the east side of tbe building. Run back onto the balcony. When you've got the both out there, Frost Nova them in place. Run over to the Relquary and shift+right-click it to open and automatically collect the reliquary. You have enough time to pick up the item before the Nova breaks. Run back to the balcony, ignore the mobs, and jump off the east side. Head towards the stone path. If you run about midway down it and don't attack pursuers, you'll escape their chase range. They'll most of the way to you, but should turn around and head before they close to melee range. At that point, you can mount up and leave however you choose. Much simpler than fighting them head-on.",

Drink your shadow potion at the beginning of Jaednar (no one will attack you, they are all green) & walk to Lord Banehollow at the end of Shadow Hold...which takes about 10 minutes or so.  Talk to him, go back to the hollow part of the cave where the bridges are and look for Ulathek the Traitor in one of the rooms.  Take out your VW, if you have not already...Talk to him & go through the dialogue.  About 4 guards will attack you along w/ Ulathek.  Focus fire on him & make sure VW area taunts.  When he is dead, loot him.  You can keep taking out the guards if you like, but I just ran away...you don't need to kill them.  The only health pot i used was when I ran.  Run back to Banehollow, speak w/ him, then purchase some dust from the guy behind him.  BE SURE YOU HAVE 150gold BEFORE DOING THIS!  Purchase the Xorothian Stardust < hearthstone > Then fly to Burning Steppes and turn in the quest.",

\
Problem~\
As with many things in wow, Blizzard did not test this quest using all classes and skill levels. Being an escort quest, we naturally want to keep the escort alive. If you are taking all the agro from the chicken, like using an AoE or multishot, the chicken will not know it is combat due to the fact that it has not been \"hit\" or damaged.\
\
Solution~\
Let the little bastard take some damage. Make sure you are in the area of the mobs AND the chicken. If you have a pet, put it on passive then TAKE the agro from the chicken. It will continue to fight for you and not run away. It will NOT however tell our friends at Blizzard to fix the problem.

Then when an add wanders in you let it run to the back and then shackle it. Kill the add after the first one is done. After you kill the add you rest for mana. You always let them wander in on their own in a 5 man, unless you are very comfortable about pulling. Every one of the abominations will wander in on it's own, so you only need to pull the first one. Always stay at the back of entryway by the gate. This way when you kill the last Abom and Rammstien comes out (his aggro range is huge), you have enough time to let the casters regain mana before he charges the group. \
\
After Rammstien dies (try to remain back in the entryway still) the army of non-elite undead come after the group, AoE them, using any way you can to make them all stay in one spot. Warriors have Challenging Shout, Tauren have War Stomp, and Mages have that Frost Nova. Just make them all stay still for the AoE and you'll be fine. \
\
As soon as those guys die the REAL hard part comes. If you've never fought the 5 elite guards in a 5 man group before, then this will be very difficult. The key is to hold off on AoE until the tank establishes aggro on all the guards. Once the tank has the aggro under control you can AoE to your heart's content. A good idea is for the Mage to do the Frost Nova followed by Arcan Explosion until he's out of mana. \

but a well organized trio can handle it too\
1) a tank that knows to hold aggro\
2) a mage that knows how to aoe\
3) a healer that knows to keep these two alive\
\
2-3 waves includes elite minibosses\
expect these waves a mage and a priest can handle easly until last wave where corrputed comes\
for these minibosses and last wave you need a tank that knows to keep aggro so that redpath is being kept alive.\
A funny quest that gives decent Agent Dawn rep. Some mobs give +1 a few gives +5 so all in all roughly 250~500 rep totally.\

Only the Bloodletters at the end are elite for the regular mobs and Redpath was considerably downgraded as well.\

It's very hard to manage to pull 1-2 mobs within the boat where all the pirates patrol around and chain-pull even more mobs. If you're 45+ then this quest definitely is soloable - but depending on your class you might spend some time corpse running.

 also, check out http://www.wowwiki.com/Bloodsail_Buccaneers, it has everything ull ever need to know about bloodsail rep\

P.S. \
oh and i also had wanted to get all rep up to exalted or w/e was possible for each, but http://www.wowwiki.com/Ravenholdt is a rogue only faction and http://www.wowwiki.com/Syndicate cant be raised other than killing Ravenholdt, but if u get below neutral w/ raven ther is NO way to get it back up again, therfore (as states in guide)    \
                \"There is one possible way for rogues to become friendly with both the Syndicate and Ravenholdt, but it would very likely require hundreds of hours, and to knowledge has not been attempted. Turning in Syndicate Emblems to Ravenholdt guards doesn't lower your reputation with the Syndicate. With this in mind, one could turn in one Emblem and gain 100 Ravenholdt reputation points and be able to kill four Ravenholdt members to gain four Syndicate Reputation points without going below Neutral with Ravenholdt. In other words you would need to pickpocket 3250 Syndicate Emblems and kill 13,000 Ravenholdt NPCs. \"\

1. Get an addon that has an \"auto-complete quest\" feature (you just need to click the quest name and it clicks \"Complete quest\" for you automatically).\

4. Right-click the NPC so the gossip window opens, then left-click the quest name and the addon completes it for you.\
5. Repeat step 4 unti Honored. :)\

Using that will make him much easier.\

There is also a high concentration of them at Owl Wing Thicket, south of Everlook almost to Frostwhisper Gorge.

\
1) Use the \"V target\" interface option so that nameplates show up above enemy NPCs. When Jandice clones, only her true form will have the name plate. DPS should target that instance.\
\
2) Have a tank to an AoE taunt like demoralizing shout. Make sure not to AoE the clones, because once the tank loses aggro on a large number of them, it's going to be difficult to get them all off of whatever person aggroed them.",

You can use the disguise that Myranda the Hag gives you to finish two other XP-rich quests in \"EZ mode\".\
\
The Mark of the Lightbringer - Part 1/2 - lvl 58 req\
(http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=9474)\
Requires you to get a box in one of the towers along the road.\
6200xp + 250 rep/Exodar, with an easy follow-up quest worth another 7750xp + 350rep\
\
Unfinished Business - Part 3/3 - lvl 55 req\
(http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=6025) \
Asks you to go up the tower that's in the middle of Hearthglen and face the main gates.\
6200xp for an elite quest and all you have to do is walk through some friendly 55-60 elites.\
\
I strongly recommend you complete both these quests before you talk to Fordring in Hearthglen, as you can't stray too far from him once he begins the escort quest. And in the worst secnario, if you get ganked, you can still run back to get another disguise from Myranda.\
\
Last note, do NOT remove your disguise when Tirion tells you to. It is NOT necessary and only makes the escort harder. The down side is that you cannot loot the bodies along the escort becase you did not aggro them, however, I find it's a small price to pay for a little extra assurance I won't die from mobs (especially at the last part when he, himself dies to mobs 9_9\")",

Use flares around the tents, to reveal the stealthed rogues.\

A bit further along you'd be ambushed by some cultists from Jadenar, further along still you'd get ambushed by 3-4 Jadefire Satyr's.  All in all it was a very difficult quest, and was very difficult to solo.  I would have counted it to be one of the most fun too.",

From either side of the Bridge:\
65,70 (from heading South before you cross the bridge, head clockwise around the chasm staying away from the edge).\
(Or: After you have crossed the bridge heading South - to the North-East. Head Anti-clockwise around the chasm staying away from the edge. Takes some getting to but would be quicker than a fight, death and re-spawn). \

There are serveral tactics to handle this quest, a good tactic would be to move everyone onto the lower part of the mountain. The tank should now pull him down there and turn his back towards the brick wall of the mountain (to avoid being knocked off) and the rest focus on DPS (some might have issues with the add spawn, if you wipe on the add, try focusing the dps towards them as a priority and then continue on the demon).\

\
\
The Descent:\
\
The mountain can be safely descended on the northside. The first jump down, to the rune of return plateau, will be the only one to cause damage. Once there drink a potion to recover the lost health and tag Razelikh to maintain the kite. \
\
From the rune of return plateau move to northern most edge. Avoid the rune itself or you will be teleported to the entrance of the tainted scar. You will be able to spot the next highest ledge, and land there by walking backwards off the plateau. Directly east of the ledge will be the obvious safe route down to the road. Be sure to tag Razelikh immediately after making the third jump. \
\
\
The Kite:\
\
Once at the base of the mountain the kite is fairly straight forward. Razelikh's only ranged attack mana burn is the best time to tag him. It is slow casting enough to tag and get out of range. \
\
Illifar so long as not damaged/tagged will bug out at the zone change between Blasted Lands and Swamp of Sorrows. He will simply stand at the arch, but will aggro if you come into range. \
\
\
Stonard:\
\
Stonard's west entrance has 4 Stonard Grunts level 65. Two at the gate, and two patrolling both bunkers.  Simply circle the north bunker until the guards have Razelikh's attention. These will more than enough to finish the boss.\
\
However when Felcular spawns he will go straight for you. Retreat into Stonard itself and run past the blacksmith on the northside of the camp to the northwest gate. There two more grunts will finish him off quickly. Be sure to tag him once so you can loot him. \
\
Level 63 Hunter using defiler's chain greaves without aspect of the cheetah used this method successfully, patch 2.2. Kept pet on Razelikh with growl disabled tagging during mana burn casts with distracting shot rank 6.\
\
Good luck and happy hunting.",

    "362814147210141472006/12/12 13:11:18kreghxJust took this guy down tonight with a 5 man group. He was pretty hard but not as hard as some people are saying. \
\
Group composition - Me - 60 Warrior (prot spec), priest (shadow spec), warlock (using imp), mage, druid. Between us we had about 6 epics - all in pre-MC and in most cases pre-Tier 0 set gear. \
\
So, how did we do it?: \
\
1) Preparation. All casters had a couple of mana pots, health pots. Priest was SS'd, warrior and druid healthstoned. I used dense sharpening stone, strength, agility, spirit scrolls, elixir of superior defense and the usual priest and druid buffs. My gear is reasonable for a non-MC warrior, 5k health unbuffed. \
\
2) Tactics. Summon Raz, warrior taunt him off whoever he goes for, everyone jumps down the hillside to the rune together, taking care to heal once down as the drop can take health off. Warrior tank him with back to hillside so that when he performs his knockback you don't get smacked off the side. \
\
3) Weaken. Use Fel Salve at the start of the fight as you wont get time once his adds pop up. We got the warlock to do it as his spells weren't doing much damage. \
\
4) DPS. Warrior sunders to 5, and everyone lays into him. Mage using arcane missiles, warlock shadowbolt, druid and warrior hitting with large pointy things. \
\
5) Add 1. At 50-60%, Ilifar turned up, and the druid tanked him in bear form while the lock and mage brought him down. I got hit with a knockback here but with my back to the wall I just bounced off and didn't get hurt. Taunt Raz back onto warrior again and continued. \
\
6) DPS 2. With Ilifar dead, I'd tank dps'd Raz down to about 45% in the meantime. We carried on with DPS til he got to around 20%. (Had to re sunder around this point.) \
\
7) Add 2. At this time, Felcular appeared. We got the druid to tank him and self heal while the rest of us continued to smack Raz. Mana was low here, the priest had all but run out, so I whacked on shield wall, healthstoned, and bought the priest some mana up time. 10% \
\
8) Finish him!. Our druid died then, but we'd held them off long enough. Execute along with the support dps finished Raz off, and I dragged Felcular off our warlock. With only one target left, he quickly went down. \
\
9) Victory! ;)",
    "36288011730801172007/05/09 01:26:39BlindcrowOkay to clear up something:  He is not immune to \"all magic\" or at least not as far as I can tell.  He IS immune to shadow, fire, fear, and banish (so as a warlock.. I was freaking useless)  arcane magic DOES seem to work on him though.\
\
I also strongly, strongly suggest a 5 man party for this.  \
\
Also a tip:  If you died but your fellow guildies who were so kind as to help you with this quest did not die, but are waiting at the bottom of the mountain for you, **please be careful about teleporting up to the top to resurrect without warning your party first** as it will pull everyone nearby up with you.  I wiped our group once that way ;)\

He hits hard, but with both of our felguards out, it was an easy enough fight. Immune to DoTs, health funnel and whatnot, we just kept our felguards healed and spammed shadowbolt. Had to use a healthstone each, but we finished it pretty quick.  I'm not sure if it would do anything, but you could try using the Fel Salve on him. We did, but didn't notice a significant difference.  The two adds he summons are non-elite. (patch 2.3)  Just take them down easy after the fight, no problem.",

This quest was very easy. Basically if you make the circuit of the pool in the shallow end once or twice you can get all the pieces without too much trouble. Be careful when you get to the eastern edge of the pool because the elite dragon (level 62 I think) Somnus patrols the area. I don't know if he seldom spawns or is a regular, but he will get you if you are not careful. \

The holy priest & I went back to hand in. As soon as I clicked on complete, a second 42 elite giant appeared and attacked us. We put him down, priest handed in the quest & clicked complete - the same thing repeated itself.\
\
From the comments on allakhazam, I was expecting a neutral giant to appear - I wasn't expecting him to appear *red* and immediately attack us. But apparently nowadays he is, so if you can't solo a 42 elite then be sure to take your group back to the hand in with you.\

No one in AH wanted to kill him, so I was stuck at lv 39 with 42 warrior and 37 rogue. It took a while, but we finally did it. Here's a neat trick that works will to kill his guards, but it requires a rogue, probably with improved sap. I don't know if this will work without.\
\
Find Fozruk and his guards just as he's leaving one of the circles of binding. Sap one of his guards, and everyone will leave the sapped guard behind. Once fozruk is a short distance away, out of relative aggro range, kill the sapped guard. They will continue walking, oblivious. Do this for all of the guards, then you can take on Fozruk solo.\
\
But you HAVE to be quick about this, because the guards respawn when he reaches the next circle of binding.",

I did it with voidwalker, since I think that's the only pet that can take such a beating. \
After that it was some tricky fear-dotting of fozruk. It's tricky because he casts a stun if he gets too close, so if you don't hit the timing on fear 100% you get stunned and hit a couple of times.\
\
I only did it mostly solo, as two friendly alliance people started hitting fozruk in the back as he hit 1k hp :)\

\
The doll pieces are more or less random, as you can see all the parts but only some are 'clickable'. All the parts are located inside houses in Darrowshire.\
\
Going near any part, whether 'clickable' or not will spawn 1-2 Ghosts of the Past. These mobs are generally easy to kill but do not award experience, items or gold.\
\
You need to collect [b](3)[/b] parts of the doll:\
[ol]\
[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12886]Pamela's Doll's Head[/url][/li]\
[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12887]Pamela's Doll's Left Side[/url][/li]\
[li][url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12888]Pamela's Doll's Right Side[/url][/li]\

\
When you have all the parts above, right click on any part of the doll to attach them. You should now have: [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12885]Pamela's Doll[/url].\

Return the quest to Pamela, at the co-ords above.\

Kolk, The First Kahn, is located just outside the little room where you create the portal to Inner Maraudon (Middle part).\
Gelk, The Second Kahn, is located outside the portal of the purple path, hanging with the rock elementals.\
Magra, The Third Kahn, is located outside the portal of the orange path, in the stairs area.\
Maraudos, The Fourth Kahn, is located inside the purple path, wandering not too far away from the instance.\
Veng, The Fifth Kahn, is located inside the orange path, wandering by the end of the path.\

On my server, nobody actually attempts these as a real PvP objective. I don't remember that ever being done. But now, they're very rarely bothered with. However, once in a while, somebody comes along trying to get back at the opposite faction or piss them off and AFKs in a tower to get it fully aligned with their faction. This can hurt your faction, as it makes towers harder to get for the oppossing faction, thus HARDER TO GET BACK for your faction. It'll make quests a lot longer and a lot more difficult for your fellow Hordies or Allies. Just don't do it.",

\
Once someone has the medallion, you must assemble an Undead Strat group or raid. Only one person in the group needs the medallion; I believe everyone that has not already completed the quest will be elgibile for the reward if you are successful. I was able to complete the quest while I still had my own medallion after our priest turned theirs in to start the quest. \
\
Aurius himself is inside of the small building (a church) just inside of UD Strat. Speak with him to start the quest for that instance. If you fail to slay the baron, you will need to obtain a new medallion (or find someone else that has it to group with). \
\
Once started, you must clear UD Strat and kill the Baron. Partway throught the fight, Aurius shows up and attacks the baron - it is to my understanding that he will also heal members of your party, as he is a paladin. Once the baron is down, Aurius collapses and allows you to complete the quest, choosing either the necklace or ring for your reward. \

    "748716353110163532006/12/16 19:46:16Odonthe1stI was looking at how to solo attune for MC on a few sites online.  It's apparently easy for rogues or druids with stealth but I thought I'd try using a hunter's skills.  I bought several Invisibility and swim speed pots but didn't need them.  I'm a level 60 NE Hunter on Durotan with  2529 armor and 3397 health, nothing special.  I had the Shadowforge key so I was able to open the 3 doors you need to get through by myself.  If you don't have the key you'll need someone to open them for you.\
\
The first door is immediately to your left as you enter the instance.  Go through that one and enter the room hugging the right wall and avoiding the patrol and open and go through the first door on right.  Go to the first door on your left and open it being careful not to run right in because there may be a patrol coming down the stairs directly in front of the doorway.  Once the Fireguard patrol goes by run up the stairs keeping to the left at the top of them. \
\
The room at the top of the first flight of stairs has several groups of mobs off to the left of the stairs and 2 Fireguard patrols.  You want to avoid the ones on either side and once the patrol has gone around the corner, wait about 5 seconds and run straight for the 2 dwarves at the start of the hallway (you'll be facing Northeast at the top of the stairs).  You're going to try to agro just those two, go around the corner, hugging the left wall so as not to agro the group in the corner off to the right.  Once you're about 1/3 of the way down the short hall, Feign Death and the two dwarves should reset.  You should time your Feign to be able to come out of it and not catch agro from any one of the groups around you, also watch out for the Fireguard pat.  There is a group straight ahead on the right so run forward hugging the left wall.  You'll see a window as you round the corner with one dwarf standing there.  Run straight through him and jump out the window.  As soon as you do you'll lose agro.  Be careful not to run right off the ledge below the window.  You want to go left as soon as you hit the ledge and jump down to the bridge below, staying away from the group in the middle.\
\
A few other options:  On my first attempt I did the room differently. I have the Stop Watch trinket (+40% speed for 10 sec), that allowed me to run right through the room, down the hallway and out the window and I had about 1/3 health left.  You don't get dazed when hit using the trinket.  There is a 30 min cooldown though so on my next try I decided to save the trinket and do it the way I describe above.  You can also use your pet.   Sic him on the 2 dwarves and run past, calling him back to you as soon as you pass.  You should both make it out the window alive.\
\
When on the bridge stay to the right to avoid the group and then move to the center and go right between the elementals.  Keep to the middle and head straight down the hall toward Incendius.  You shouldn't agro the first two pairs but the last pair before Incendius is too close together.  I died twice just running past them because they do a fair amount of damage and once I hit the lava I was gone before I got through.  Use your pet.  Time it so that as you run through to jump off the bridge Incendius will be on the far side of his path and won't notice you.

\
As you hit the lava (AH!) turn left and jump-swim to the wall on your left.  Jumping seems to help you take less damage but maybe be ready to take a health pot before you clear the lava.  If you run along the slope away from your pet real fast you may be able to get far enough away for him to disappear before he dies, saving you from one rez/feeding later. Stay to the left, running and jumping until you cant go any farther on the slope.\
\
You'll run out of slope with a wide pool of lava to your right.  There is an island out there with 4 fireguard on it.  In between you and the island is a Fireguard pathing around unseen below the surface of the lava.  Have elemental tracking activated and click around in the lava till you select him. Hunter's Mark him so you can watch his movements (he goes too far under the surface sometimes but you see the mark every few sec).  If you're in a group and leader (doesn't matter where in Azeroth the other player is) you can use Raid targets also, these may be easier to see).   When he's a pathing away from you to your right jump in the lava and head for the island.  I took a health pot here but might have made it without.  You want to just barely get on the tip of the island and stop so as not to agro the 4 Fireguard there. \
\
Heal up and summon your pet. Turn to make sure your pet doesn't summon right in the lava or it'll die real fast (duh! sorry kitty). Send the pet in to attack the Fireguard on the back left and run in a few sec later.  Run past and jump off the back left side of the island, jump/swim through the lava to the 1st landing you can get to.  I had a Fireguard coming after me and feigned once I hit the landing.  Let your pet die and then rez them.  Up the ramp and to your left is your goal.  Two groups of 3 Fireguard guard the ends of the bridge leading to the Molton Core portal.  Your core fragment is to the left of the portal.  Send your pet to the 1st group and run past.  When it dies and they come after you feign in the middle of the bridge and let them reset.  Same for the next group, but when you feign do it behind the core fragment.  When the group resets pop up and grab your fragment!  Do a little dance! You did it!  Now if you're in a group or have a friend somewhere that will join with you, convert to Raid (open your Social window, click Raid tab at bottom, and click on \"Convert to Raid\").  Jump in MC portal, jump back out and it'll take you right to Lothos to turn in the quest.  Ta-da! you're done.\
\
I did a video of the whole thing but I used fraps and it split the move into 2 files and also I play at 1200x1600 and even at \"half size\" capture the files are huge.  I may try it again using real small screen resolution.  Until then I have a bunch of screen caps.",

Begin by going through the gate to the left of the entrance to BRD, then go through the gate to the right, then the small door (all of this requires shadowforge key). then go up the stairs and take the path to the left. You should come upon 2 windows, one leading onto a bridge, and teh other to a road, jump out onto the ledge to the bridge and tehn onto the bridge. Theere may or may not be a group of mobs waiting for you. if there are, kill them, and then proceed towards incendius ( fire elemental boss next to the anvil). After he is dead jump down to the left and continue in this direction untill you get to a wall/ledge jutting rather higher out of the lava. Use TAB to find the elemental hiding in the lava have a hunter or mage pull him (warrior and rogue bow range might not be enough to reach it)then heal up and lava jump across to the small island, note that there are 4 elementals standing on it, if you are very careful not to get any closer than you absolutly need to be to stop taking fire damage, you should pull unless you are below lvl 57. after they are dead (pulling 1-2 at a time) jump across to the ramp and then stop where it splits off into 2 paths, one leading to the black forge and one to 3 linked elementals. If you have a warlock, banish is recomended. Kill them the go along the bridge to the MC portal, kill the group of mobs, and look to the left of the portal. There should be a stalagmite/tite,cant remember which is which ><, on the ground, inside is the core fragment. Convert to a raid and eneter MC and then leave to quickly get back to lothos to complete the quest. Warning: If you enter MC without getting the fragment you will have to go all teh way back through BRD again to get it as you will be next to lothos and not even in the instance anymore.",

Then pick up the unlocked quests, Western Crystal Pylon, Northern Pylon, and Eastern Pylon.  Now head over to the Northern Pylon @ http://www.wowhead.com/?object=164955, that same area is where you will find your 10 Pterrodax.  Now once you've finished there, head over to the Eastern Pylon @ http://www.wowhead.com/?object=164957.  Continue on towards the Western Pylon @ http://www.wowhead.com/?object=164956.  (Side note: I suggest you cut through The Marshlands with all the Ravasaurs for time, but once you hit the Slithering Scar stick to the wall of Un'goro until you reach the Western Pylon, you'll find a few Frenzied Pterro's along the way.).  Much like the Northern Pylon you'll find that the same hill which has the Western Pylon is a wonderful spot to kill most of the 15 Frenzied Pterrodax required by the quest.  Their levels range from 31-33 and you don't have to worry about large roaming elites.  There you go, knocked out 4 quests :].\

At level 51 (Lowest possible level for the quest) You may be able to slay a few hordies in the battleground, but i advice you to stay away from the bosses in the keep and the big towers, because their \"aoe\" attacks (just like a warrior's cleave) is able to deal enough damage to take out a level 60 with 6000 armor in only 3-5 hits.\
You need a lot of armor and at least 1 dedicated healer to survive these guys.\
\
As for the quest; Drek'thar himself is in the big horde keep in the frostwolf camp in the very south of the battleground. Normal gameplay lets the alliance take the frostwolf relief hut, then 10-15 enters and attacks Drek'thar.\
I am not sure if you get the kill by simply being in the battleground (Staying in the first alliance base) But i do know that you dont actually have to attack Drek'thar yourself. Healing, helping, or just simply being near it is more then enough.\

You can spam the weapon's use effect nearly continuously.\

Effects the weapon has on bosses (when used):\
[ul][li][b]Grol[/b] - it shrinks him, making his attacks WAY weaker. As a level 60 druid in bear form i had no chance to survive without using the weapon. Remember to use the weapon as soon as you see him grow back.[/li]\
[li][b]Lady Sevine[/b] - after few tries we discovered that using a weapon can interrupt her summoning of infernals. We were duoing it with a rogue as dps, and me - druid tanking, so only a rogue get to use her weapon and wasn't as effective as two people could be when it comes to interrupts, but it reduced the number of mobs hitting us.[/li]\
[li][b]Allistarj[/b] - we used a weapon on him of course, but I cannot say what it really did. We had no problems with downing him, and I believe each group (even group of two ;) ) doing this quest won't have problems here.[/li][/ul]\

\
For both Stormwind and Ironforge it is advised to get to the tram as fast as possible.  Dying your way through Ironforge front gates takes a long time.  Stormwind was easy when I took the tram.  \
\
Stormwind you should navigate via the waterway.  You shouldn't have too much trouble, plus you can sneak right up and out of sight of the majority of players who are guarding it.  I just went from the tram to the nearest water and swam the whole way popping up and taking that flag.\
\
Ironforge is straight forward, run and die.  It took a lot of times dying to do that.  Eventually you get there.  I would take the tram and save a lot of deaths that way.  There is one or two patrolling guards.  They seem to both leave at the same time so it is easy to time it.\
\
Darnassus is hard to tell.  Sneaking played a big roll in me figuring it out.  I snuck on the boat, and then snuck up to the fire.  It's outside the town so it should be easy to get to.  Hiding beneath the bridge is advisable, but make sure there are no guards walking on it first.\
\
Last thing to be noted is that I got 4950exp from each flame I turned in and then another 4950 exp from getting the crown.  A nice 20k exp benefit is a fairly good motivator for most people.\
\
I hope this saves a few people some trouble.  Good Luck to you all.\

    "2870211996102119962008/01/03 03:42:01z32o[quote=By regarr on 12/15/2006]He is located in in a cave on the island south of Feathermoon Stronghold at 28,71.[/quote]\
\
For the Protection Paladins out there:\
\
I've soloed this quest at level 47, and I found it pretty easy, but rather slow, because you just can't run in aggroing all mobs, most of them are naga sorceress that use Frost Magic and even with your [/i]Frost Resistante Aura (Rank 2)[/i] you won't be able to take less than 100 dmg per cast, lucky then tend to stab you with their stick sometimes.\
\
The second problem is that when these naga are at 15% or lower health, they will run, aggroing other mobs, so I guess you realized you'll be using the [/i]Judgement of Justice[/i] all the time, for preventing them to run. I would recommend using [/i]Hammer of Wrath[/i] when they run, but the mobs here are pretty close to each other, so it would be dangerous.\
\
After you enter the cave, have some things in mind:\
[ul]\
[li]The mobs are real close to each other.[/li]\
[li]75% of the mobs inside are casters.[/li]\
[li]The mobs respawn really fast[/li]\
[li][b][IMPORTANT][/b] Remember that casters can't attack you if you aren't in their line of sight. This cave has decent corners and pillars to hide behind, so that they must chase you, instead of you needing to get to them, which would be dangerous, because you would aggro more mobs.[/li]\
[/ul]\
\
So here is a typical strategy for fighting your way to Lord Shalzaru:\
[ol]\
[li]Load up [i]Seal of Justice[/i][/li]\
[li]Aggro mob and make it come to you[/li]\
[li]Use [i]Judgement[/i][/li]\
[li]Load up [i]Seal of Light[/i][/li]\
[li]Repeat[/li]\
[/ol]\
\
After you reach the dead end of the cave, you will notice that the mobs you killed all the way along are already respawning. As you look to Lord Shalzaru, he will be protected by 2 casters. Please, notice the column of stone on their right side, make your way up to behind that column and wait for the right moment to aggro the caster mob that protects Lord Shalzaru, it will begin to cast [i]Frostbolt[/i], then hide behind the stone column, she will follow you, without aggroing Lord Shalzaru. After you kill this caster mob, it will be easy, as Lord Shalzaru himself uses more melee than spells. Just aggro and kill him, don't forget to take the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=9248][Mysterious Relic][/url] that he drops (because this quest isn't about killing him, it's about recovering that relic.\
\
[b]note:[/b] if you are a miner that can harvest Mithril, the veins respawn very quickly. While I was inside the cave I got 5 points up in Mining from only 2 harvest points.\

4150 XP and 150 Rep with Darnassus\
Also unlocks [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=2871]Delivering The Relic[/url], which consist of talking to a NPC (on the same building where Latronicus Moonspear is) and you will receive more 5550 XP and 250 Rep with Darnassus.",

\
She wanders around even more then Ursius, so giving exact coords are very hard. Look at her page (Click on the \"Brumeran Slain\" link on this page) for coords. I would, however, recommend waiting and looking around 62.5, 57.9 for her, as you can fight her without risk of adds (It's on or near the road.)\
\
She's a 58 elite Chimera with lightning breath and a stackable poison effect. Nature protection would be recommended here. The poison will eat down at your health fairly quickly. I'd recommend bringing a nature protection potion (And/or some Anti-Venom) or a priest. Mages (Frost especially) shouldn't have much problem assuming that they have bandages and potions at the ready. I'm assuming that locks shouldn't have much problem either. For other classes, I'd recommend hunting her with some other people, or pulling her to the Everlook guards. (Make sure that, if you try this, that you get enough damage on her so that you receive credit when the guards kill her.) (I also don't know if it's possible to do anymore. It would help if someone would confirm this for me.) Of course, depending on your gear and level, you may have a little or alot of trouble dealing with her. I'd always reccomend finding a group.\
\
For those without a UI, she's in the wilderness ranging from a little below the frozen lake going south past the group of elite dragonkin. She goes south from there. I would recommend waiting for her around an alliance NPC along the road leading south. You should find her around there. If you want to hunt for her in the wilderness, following the listings of coordinates on Brumeran's page (Click the Brumeran Slain link) should give you a good idea of her path.",

For a lower level your best bet is going to Dalson's Tears itself. (Always remember that the trick of grinding is killing mobs that you can finish off in 20 seconds or less and that respawn fast). \

When you have a good amount of Runecloth and Somatic Intensifiers head to Chillwind Camp and buy some Arcane Quickeners from the AD Alchemist (Those are expensive and if you dont use them fast they will despawn from your bags, so only buy what you need).

After you get off the bridge, go to your left and down the ramp but mind the croc's.  The croc's are in groups of 4-5 so it would be wise NOT to agro them if at all possible.  Once in the water, just swim clockwise around Hakkar's Temple.  The Frenzy's in the water are level 60 elite, so you should not have much trouble dispersing them if need be.  Once on the other side of Hakkar's Temple opposite of where you started, you will see Pagle's Point.

They will randomly hit nearby members or the one who generates high threat (such as curing or taunting) and slowly chase them.  They also cast fear so it is highly important to have them pulled as far back as possible and other members must not run up or wait halfway to meet them, otherwise they may find themselves getting feared into the large room before they even engage the main tank.\

Corpse Eaters need to be stunned so that they do not consume any nearby corpses as they will regenerate most of their health if they eat.  Normal damage will only slow them down a little and will not stop them from eating.\

The High Priests nuke shadow bolts from a distance, summon non-elite skeletons, and can run away when low health so be sure to use earthbind totems, crippling poisons, or stun them before they go and fetch help.\

    "4125159410111497252007/09/27 12:50:50VersadesFor those of you who do not have coordinates, the best hint is to look for wreckage along the shore of the main land across from the Isle of Dread (i.e.  southeast of Feathermoon Stronghold almost on a 45 degree angle).  Proceed quite a ways south of the inlet along the mountains, as mentioned above, until you find wreckage on the beach.  It is in a very small cove.\
\
Or, if you prefer, proceed to swim, at a 45 degree angle across the Strait.  This is deep water and you will get Fatigue.  I just managed this in druid aquatic form, can also be done with potions.  I have done it with my human rogue.  So stock water breathing and swim speed if you want to play around with this idea.\
\
The boat is upside down and completely submerged, but it is no longer below the sand.  (Once upon a time all you could see was the rudder, now the entire hull is exposed)  So there is a large clickable spot, and you can see it clearly as a boat.  There is no mistaking this once you see it.\
\
However, the water is highly reflective and that is what keeps you from recognizing the boat itself when you are on the land.  So once you are in the area and see the wreckage, scan the waterline until your cursor turns into the gear.\
\
Soloed as (44) balance druid and (40+) Rogue mobs are a pain.  All 48-49 the giants are elite as mentioned above.",

They give a nasty debuff that reduces agi by 15% and swim speed by 20%. They shouldn't be a problem to deal with when diving for the book, but watch out, as they will likely aggro when you do dive.\
\
Also, inside the scar where the Sword is, there are plenty of sludges that won't be happy about your presence. I believe they give an annoying debuff as well, but I think they're easier to avoid than the elementals were.",

Follow the road north from Corin's Crossing until you get to the bridge. Go west along the \"scar\" until you reach the hills, you should see Blackwood Lake. The skull is very near to the eastern shore, near some non-hostile ghosts.\

Now head southeast back in the direction of Corin's Crossing.  On the western edge of the scar are two \"fingers\" that stick out, the sword is closest to the northernmost one.  Just jump down, or go around to the \"ramp\" but it's faster just to jump. There are some non-hostile ghosts nearby, and it glows pinkish.",

Using your Vitreous Focuser collect Ectoplasmic Resonators off the corpses of the undead around 'Gahrron's Withering Cauldron'. The reason why you cleanse 'Gahrron's Cauldron' over and over again is because it has a higher reputation reward. You will also be collecting scourgestones but please keep these till you are pasted 1/2 through Revered with the Dawn. Once you collect 4x Ectoplasmic Resonators, 4x Runecloth go to Alchemist Arbingto in Chillwind Camp and buy 1x Arcane Quickener. Then go back to the cauldron and use it. Doing this will give the player 25 (27-28 if Human) reputation points with the Argent Dawn. I would collect around 80x Ectoplasmic Resonators at a time and cleanse the cauldron twenty times. This quest can be done over and over again. However the 'Arcane Quickeners' cost money, 45 silver. The runecloth is picked up off the corpses of the undead mobs, and you usually have more than you need. \
\
Using only the Cauldron quest to gain reputation from Revered (50%) to Exalted you will need all of the following: \
\
1680x Ectoplasmic Resonators \
1680x Runecloth \
420x Arcane Quickener (Total cost: 189 gold (PvP Rank 3: 168 gold)) \
\
Scourgestones \
Most undead mobs in WPL, EPL and the instances drop Scourge Stones of some kind. Collect these stones and put them in your bank. They will stack to 250 so you shouldn't run out of space. As the reputation gains become harder after you get passed 50% in Revered I would keep them to use then. You will get 25 (27-28 if Human) points of reputation for each turn in of 20x Minion's Scourgestones, 10x Invader's Scourgestones, and 1x Corruptor's Scourgestones. However, the Argent Dawn quests at Revered and Exalted require some tokens (Revered: 10, Exalted: 25) so you will have to spend some for those quests. Once you turn in the stones you might as well use the tokens to gain addition reputation. \
\
Amounts of ScourgeStones needed to get to Exalted from Revered (50%): \
\
Minion's Scourgestones: 4200* \
Invader's Scourgestones: 2100* \
Corruptor's Scourgestones: 210* \
\
*These figures include spending the Valour Token reward from turning in the stones. \
\
Healthy Dragon Scales \
This quest is from picking up Healthy Dragon Scales from within Scholomance off of Plagued Hatchlings and returning them to Betina Bigglezink at Lighthopes Chappel in EPL. Each scale is a quest itself, start the quest and then talk to Betina Bigglezink. You can carry as many of these scales as you can. The drop rate of these scales is low as the prereg quest is Plagued Hatchlings and that isn't done by many people. Each scale gives the player 50 (55 for Humans) reputation points with the Argent Dawn. \
\
Total number of scales needed from Revered (50%) to Exalted: 210 \
\
Since the 1.11 patch there are more options for getting to exalted. \
\
Turning in the repeatable quests for the different collectiable items: \
\
For insignia of the crusade turn-ins: \
crypt fiend parts \
bone fragments \
\
For insignia of the dawn turn-ins: \
savage frond \
cores of elements \
dark iron scraps \
\
gets you 10 rep with AD each turn-in of 30. \
\
At Revered, turning in 7 each of the insignias of the dawn and crusade \
will get you one of the superior armaments of the dawn (I would take the 18 slot bag) You also get 100 ad rep. for first turn in. \
So, not only do you get an 18 slot bag, but you get 380 ad rep total with it.",

\
Before you start killing the Winterfall Furbolgs, make certain you have done the Winterfall Activity quest.  (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8464)  Once you complete the quest, you will then be able to collect Winterfall Spirit Beads (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21383) for the Beads for Salfa quest (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8469).  \
\
This way, you shall be able to grind not only Wintersaber Trainer faction, but you can also grind Timbermaw faction as well with the bead turn-ins.\
\
On a seperate note, if you are getting frustrated by the presence of people in or around the Winterfall camp, if they are of the same faction as yourself, try and see if you can get together in a single party.  Unlike the meat drops, since you are farming for kill counts here, so long as as you are not in a raid every kill will count to the whole group.\
\
However, if they are of the opposite faction there is one (maybe two) things you could do.  First, you could either put up with them and try to tag mobs before they do.  The second bit is a bit more evil and requires a lot of patience to get the ability to do this.\
\
Just ignore the fact that it lists this as Horde only, this quest is available to both factions once they hit exalted with Timbermaw.  It's called The Root of All Evil (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8481).  It gives you a torch that you can use to summon an elite demon to that cave north of the Winterfall Village.  The demon will then try and lay waste to anyone who is unlucky enough to get close to it.  He'll make short work of most farmers, but (and I'm not completely certain on this) until you complete, drop, or fail the quest itself (or maybe log out or leave the area?), he won't despawn.",

Many people may think that waiting for patch to do this grind is quite wise thing to do, but I think that many people will think te same way and several weeks after patch the village will be swarmed all the time, so if waiting for mobs to spawn annoys and you're already revered or close to, do not wait for patch.",

One thing to take note of: shamans are the rare spawns on this quest.  If i'm the only one farming the village (late late night :P) I try to keep the bottom and middle floor clear of denwatchers and ursas so that shamans have room to spawn.  If you ride up the mountain overlooking the village, there is a whole ridge of Ursas, so you need to maintain a supply of shamans to keep the pace up.\
\
There are 2 patrols that can spawn as shamans as well, on top of the ridge and in front of the village.  If they aren't a shaman, they are a denwatcher, so just take it out and hope for a shaman spawn next time you come back from turning in.\
\
The runners that come through the village do not aggro by proximity but they are social atleast to the chief, so be careful.\
\
There are chests that spawn at both the houses on the edges of the upperlevel, and both the houses at the edge of the bottom level.  I've pulled greens, blues, etc out of them, but usually get ores, bars, food, herbs, water, etc :P  Some of the grinders I quested with completely ignored the chests to save time doing the quest; whatever floats your boat eh? : )\
\
There is a named rare spawn thats also a good snag for greens; he spawns near the chief: http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=10199\
\
When running back to the Quest NPC to turn this quest in, you want to have all your riding speed gear on and basically make a bee-line over the mountain ridges, avoiding mobs because they will knock you off your mount.\
\
You can eventually get very fast at this quest, especially if you can maintain a spawn of shamans up.  Grouping with people, whether or not they are doing the quest, can help a lot as well.\
\
There used to be a bug where you would get credit for quest kills halfway across the map of winterspring, but that was fixed quite some time ago : P",

But the biggest problem is that these elementals only attack with frost, so you won't be absorbing any damage, your redoubt will have no use, either Holy Shield, so it's like fighting when you were a Lv10 Paladin, also your Frost Resistance Aura (Rank 2) will only absorb some of the attack, and it will not absorb completely, you'll still take 98-120 dmg with each attack.

Not sure if that's quite worth the frustratingly low drop rate....I will not be doing the repeatable part either, screw that.",

I've been killing them for 30 minutes and not a single drop off the water elementals. I've been thinking I didn't have the quest or was supposed to do something, but it is, in fact, a horrible quest. 3/4 of my kills in this time have been water elementals, 1/4 giants, and I'm 7/15 on giants with 0/10 on water elementals.

All of the quests in this chain CAN be done with 5 (or 10 as appropriate) people who aren't all epic'ed out.  It's just not easy, or cheap.\

However, considering the addition of the expansion in the very near future, I would have to agree.  Drop this chain, and put no more effort into it, unless you simply want to have one of each set of gear.

After numerous kill quests and a trip to Live Strath you will go to hearthglen in disguise.  Only with this disguise buff can you speak to Highlord Taelan Fordring and do this quest. \
\
You can keep your disguise on for a long time.  No need to remove it when he says.  The quest is very easy while you are in hearthglen, just let him kill everything and try not to get aggro from the elites.  \
\
Once you get outside you will be attacked by 5 lvl 60 elites.  He can kill them all on his own if you let him.  You will not fail for dying at this stage if you can get rezzed immediately to catch up with the Highlord.\
\
The last part is kinda rough.  The highlord will take you to the tower where everyone farms for Crusader enchants and yell for the Inquisitor to come out.  Do not attack them...it will take a little bit but eventually the Highlord will engage.  He will handle the main guy and he tells you to \"deal with the crimson elites\".  Doing this with just myself and a shaman proved to be fairly difficult.  There are only two guards with him but a group of 5 comes down the path and engages as well.  \
\
I am not sure if these auto aggro you, or if you can let them aggro the highlord as well.  When i did it we got aggro and it was a mess.  The shaman ended up dying and even with a combat rez right away he failed the quest.\
\
The highlord basically ends up getting owned and Tirion Fordring (the original quest giver) comes to save the day.  If you can avoid getting aggro he will handle all the elites and you will get your nice reward.\

Highlord Taelan Fordring can kill everything on the way out, even at the gate. He will get to about 1% hp then use lay on hands to heal himself to full.\

A little advice on this quest.\
Like other before have said, clear out the immediate area around the cage.\
Once you open it, a Shaman will spawn right next to the door, Hit him immediately and all sprite will attack him. He'll die instantly. Next focus you attention on the mobs on the path directly infront of the cage. Take out grimtotems that are attacking the sprites one by one. Ignore every other sprite just focus on the ones straight ahead. \

Don't worry bout the ones that will behind the cage.",

I then hit Fel Domination, brought him right back with full health (real pain trying to get him to grab all the agro again). \
\
This was hard for me. I burned everything i had to finish this quest. In the end I had 23 health points, 2 mana points and zero demon pets. If you really want this done, i'm sure you can do it, but be prepared to get frustrated. If I had to do it again, I would get help or hit it at a higher lvl.",

I neglected to pick up Jaron's supplies that appear in a small crate right next to the wagon.  Do not make that mistake; it's easy to do.  Then go east across the road toward Owl Wing Thicket and fight more owlbeasts to find the \"blue-feathered amulet\".  It dropped from the very first one that I fought.

Separating them is easy: just summon and immediately run away until they turn back (like any mob). Speed helps to avoid getting hit, I suppose. Once they're both summoned and just sitting around the obelisk, just pull and only one should come.\

Both drakes are immune to stun, entangling roots and hibernate. Kick wasn't interrupting their dragon breath, either, though it works on the nearby elites.\

\
Dragons are immune to fire, fear and horror. Hematus is slightly harder to kill than Backlash. Pull one dragon at a time with a shadowbolt and start kiting while putting all dots up and sending voidwalker on for damage add (turn his spells off, he can't taunt worth sh-t and you need to drain his mana during the fight anyway). Kite back and forth, or in a circular motion if you have room for it. Use Death Coil in beginning of fight to have it ready again near end of fight.\
Occasionally the dragons might stop to breathe fire on your voidwalker, this is a good time to cast Drain Life if you have good distance. Be ready to sacrifice voidwalker at any time, both dragons can do crits not far from 1000 on cloth.",

\
Hematus ability: Flame Buffet - Does fire damage and increases fire damage taken by an amount. Stacks\
\
If you're trying to kite these two, keep in mind that they can be pulled seperately, run slightly faster than normal runspeed, and hit fairly hard. (I was crit for 850)\
\
If you're trying this as a Frost Mage (fire won't be able to, as they are fire-immune) here are some tips.\
\
Always try to keep Ice Barrier up, to avoid being crushed\
\
Make use of blink, you should be able to blink far enough ahead to get one frostbolt off before running.\
\
Use your water elemental twice, once after a cold snap. He'll be doing a whole lot of damage while you kite.\
\
Try and bounce the drake between you and your elemental via Ice Blocking.\

That said, I don't really see the calcs done as being accurate to the truth either.

\
for Revered to Exalted you need 21000 rep\
21000 / 75 = 280 turn-ins\
280 turn-ins = 2800 Morrowgrain\
\
Morrowgrain drops approx 37.9% of the time according to wowhead stats, but drops 1 - 5 morrowgrain each time it does.\
at 2.5 morrowgrain per drop, 37.9% of the time - you will need roughly 425 Evergreen Herb Casings.\
\
Casings are made from 2x Un'Goro Soil and 1x Packet of Tharlendris Seeds, so this means 850 soil and 425 seeds.\
The seeds are sold by a vendor in Darnassus for 10s each (is this affected by rep?) therefore the seeds will cost you 42.5g\
\
Un'Goro Soil drops most in Un'Goro Crater from the Gorishi bug things, roughly 1/3 of the time, maybe a bit more. This means you will need to kill around 2500 of these mobs to get your soil, assuming you don't pick any soil up from the ground. If anyone can estimate how long you'd be killing mobs to get that done and how often you'd come across a pile of soil that'd be wonderful.\
\
Last on the list is the 10 minute cooldown on cultivate seeds, this means that once you have spent your 42.5g to buy packets of seeds, and killed your 2500 Gorishi mobs to collect 850 bits of soil, you need to spend 70 hours and 50 minutes cultivating them. I suggest you do it while you grind tbh.",

I achieved exalted status with Darnassus at level 39 doing nothing more than quests and the wool & silk turnins.  Finding and doing all the quests did take time, but much of it was while levelling normally, and the extra was maybe 10 hours of effort.\
\

    "84031076710107672006/12/08 09:24:17SaphirahI agree, but it is always good to leave a few behind on D in the beginning. Why? Because regardless of whether or not they send in their whole force, the rezzers can get to the main group within seconds to help get the opponents flag BACK across the field. It's usually about 70% of the time they all go Offense and the other 30% they leave a few behind as well. \
\
It's trial and error, there are several strategies for any of the situations. The big thing is trying to get a PuG team to not stay midfield farming honor kills and get them to participate in running the flag, which has always been the problem with PuG groups. Preformeds are easier, you are in vent usually and everyone knows their job.\
\
But yes, you are correct for most games. Having someone in the Flagroom calling out the direction the flag is going makes it easier to get it back though.",
    "84031076110107612006/12/08 09:22:23phobishalf the team controls mid field. The other half goes for the flag. Once the flag team comes to mid field, move as a team to intercept the other team and return your flag. This works well if the other team is a pug. \
\
One big problem with WSG is gear. The better your gear, the better your advantage is over the other team. And healers, CC and pallis. \
\
Just my 2cents",
    "84031074810107482006/12/08 09:14:33AkiraRyuseiThe main problem is that the horde rarely show up alone.\

Most games I'm in see the main forces of both armies just rush by one another. One or two or even three defenders isn't going to survive fighting the whole team. Mostly we get steam-rolled over before we can get a warning into /bg.",

    "84031072810107282006/12/08 09:04:41SaphirahNot much you can really say about this quest, it's pretty much point blank. However, I would highly recommend, depending on your group makeup as well as whether or not you are a preformed or not, putting a few on defense (Hunters and Rogues) and have your tanks and healers and CC on Offense. SOmetimes your defense can stop the carrier if he is alone, otherwise they are there to slow them down and announce to the raid the direction the flag is going in order for your offense to get the flag back once the opponents flag is safely at home base. \
\
Good hiding spots are in abundance, just ensure you rotate these places to throw off potential onslaughts. And whether you agree or not, Free Action potions, health potions, Mana potions and even the occassional Swiftness potion are highly recommended in order to gain advantage.",
    "84031080310108032006/12/08 09:42:21SaphirahWell, unfortunately that won't work too well. If the opposition are smart enough to focus fire your healers (which they do) you will all die off fairly quickly. The idea in WSG is CC. Once your carrier gets the flag you should never stop to kill anyone. Sheep them, fear them, blind them, Sap them, hamstring them, piercing howl them...anything you can to keep them from getting to your carrier. \
\
Once your carrier is safe and all healers are with him/ her, you send out your offense to get the flag back.\
\
Sending out a wall, while it sounds fun;) Will more than likely not work.",

\
Secondly, this quest chain seems to be an incomplete one. \
\
After you turn in the Chained Essence of Eranikus to Itharius and go to visit Umbranse, the chain dead ends with its completion.  He will not point you to another questgiver or give you any task to complete.  Though it would seem that what he says would, logically, lead to another part, it does not, which is a disappointment.\

Got this enchantment from quest and as a lvl 47 Warrior still using trusty Whirlwind Axe with a small enchant on already and expecting to upgrade this weapon soon I thought I would use the Fiery Blaze on my Trinket weapon which as yet not having a One Hand weapon to go with this Main hand Hammer of Expertise, I use it with a shield but the weapon is summoned by a trinket for 1 hour use with a 3 hour cool down. This enchant worked great and even alongside +6 Weightstone. However when resommoning the weapon after cooldown- no enchant. I suppose it is a different weapon each time you summon it from the trinket. Wish I'd kept it for partner One hand when I eventually obtain one or even put it on Whirlwind Axe.   Plonker eh?",

There are level 37-39 creeping alien dudes here, making this a little tricky, but being a 49 druid, I could just prowl to it. Once you enter the Spiral, there is a narrow tunnel, with different parts branching off from it. Take your first left. Proceed through the tunnel with caution, 'cause there's still alien dudes in here. Go to the end of that  the tunnel, and then take the only other tunnel that has been untraveled (the tunnel you didn't come in through) in this little room. After a few seconds of traveling through this tunnel, there's a fork in the road. Take the left, (Man, you have to take left A LOT!!!,) and then you enter a REALLY WEIRD ROOM, and after taking a few steps into this room, turn left. Travel down that tiny little part of the room and there's the Surveying Gear. It takes a while, but hey, you get 6300experience and 250 rep. with Gadgetzan!",

After the circular room at the first fork go right. You will enter a large room. The Scrimshank's Surveying Gear (55, 71) is at the western side of the room.\

\
Once in that tunnel, it say to go right, that ended me in a small deadend room. so it tried left. that was the right way !!!!\
\
Next after the round room, it says go right, again deadend, so I backtracked and went left, this was the right way.\
\
The only thing that was right that I could find, was the location of the spiral and the co-ords of the quest item itself, and the fact that the quest item is in the western side of the room. The butterfly shapped room like someone else said, is the best way to know if you in the right room.\

He can be found inside a cave called the Slag Pit. It's the second cave from the left. Once inside work your way in and turn left when you see a gate. There will be a winding ramp up and soon enough you'll see a balcony with Overseer Maltorius and his adds. It's at about 40,36, don't mistake this co-ordinate for the same area above ground.\
\
When I did this quest I found a rare spawn but he's pretty easy to take down so I took him down first. There are two ways to go about doing this, one is to keep them scattered and focus dps on one, and the other is to use a form of CC and focus dps on one. I would recommend taking out each of the two guards before moving on to the Overseer as he has about 14,000HP and hits pretty hard. \
\
Behind him is the plans for the quest \"What the Flux?\". If you're just after that you could fear them all, run in, get the plans and jump out.",

Be careful, the guy crits for 450-480 on plate (no shield), and the other two elite are pretty tough too.\

All pirates can drop the hat, the drop rate is listed around 15-20%, but this does not include people whom are not on the quest, or have already completed the quest and went back there for what ever reason..\

As with any 'random' system, there will be streaks of both good and bad luck... from my experiences I would not peg the drop rate quiet at 40-50%, but at least 20%, probably 30%.\

Several quests involve killing Grel'borg, so don't be surprised to find other people also hunting him down at the same time.\
\
The Hand of Dagun comes from Dagun the Ravenous (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=2937), a named water giant that is summoned on an island to the north of Theramore. You will know it's the right island when you see a small glowy orb on an altar. To summon Dagun, you need to kill the Mirefin Oracles for a quest item called \"Enchanted Sea Kelp\" -- it only drops from the oracles and may take a while (it's always taken me at least ten minutes of killing to get it on all of my alts). Once you have the  Sea Kelp, you click on the altar and Dagun will rise up from the sea.\
\
Finally, the Legacy Heart comes from Mogh the Undying (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=1060), a named troll in central Stranglethorn Vale (you can find him in some ruins directly south of the Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound). I believe that he is the hardest to finish (unless in a group) since he's surrounded by many mobs that also respawn fairly quickly. Either bring a friend or two or be 44+, because it's pretty hellish clearing when you're underlevel and soloing.",

Best advice is to go as a group, but if you want to try him solo, clear the area as much and as quickly as possible.  Respawn rates for these trolls are insane.  You should be able to clear the area down to Mogh, his minion, and maybe one other troll, probably the Headhunter closest to him.  You can try a couple strategies, one of which is to target Mogh and bring him down fast.  Or you can try killing the minion first if it seems like he is healing Mogh faster than you can burn him down.  If I recall, I concentrated on killing Mogh, though.  After all, he is the object of the quest, and he's tough.",

\
The other thing is that Mogh is surrounded by mobs that i had to pick off one by one until it was down to Mogh, his minion and another headhunter that I couldn't get close enough to kill on his own. Once it was down to those three, I went into Cat form, pounced his little boy and killed him first. With him out of the way, you don't have to worry about Mogh getting healed mid-battle. After that i was able to kill the mob, heal, and then take down Mogh.\

Dark Keeper Vorfalk Grim Guzzler Tavern \
Dark Keeper Zimrel Arena; upper seating area \
Dark Keeper Uggel Top of ramp in Golem Room w/Fineous \
Dark Keeper Pelver Domicile room (storeroom in center) \
\
All but 2 are fairly easy to do. \
Bethek spawns almost instantly outside the Coffer room, so be prepared. \
Vorfalk is surrounded by patrons in the Grim Guzzler. To get to him, you have to pull the patrons around him, 1 by 1, with the Dark Iron Ale. \
Just make sure you kill the patron before they drink it, as it's limited in supply. \
After all that, the Burning Essence is still a 50% drop, so you may need a few attempts before you get it.",

The dodge chance given is exactly 4.7% so two of these is 9.4% which is huge...so basically it is like have 2 lives with the dodge and damage absord added together.\

To the people saying that minor recombobulator is better, correct me if im wrong, but isnt that alliance only obtainable recipe, meaning it is hard/almost impossible for a horde player to get it and when u do have it the, 150-250 HP restore is barely worth it when u have upwards of 1.5k HP.

1. The green trinket, the quest item - is bop, and only levels 35+ can equipp it.\
2. However, this does not have to be equipped in any way to complete the quest, where the blue trinket is the reward.

Continue going the only way you can through the Hold.  After maybe 8-10 mobs, you will go down a hallway which ends in a room.  From the hallway you should be able to see the succubus Rakaiah standing in front of an altar, which is surrounded by four Darkweavers.  You should be able to pull Rakaiah by herself.  She is not difficult at all, and if you've managed to make it this far, you should make short work of her.  After she's down, you'll see a yellow question mark light up over the altar.  Trey Lightforge's remains are on this altar.  You can pull the Darkweavers one at a time.  Be sure to get all four before using the altar.

DM North:\
From the entrance, walk across the courtyard, avoiding the dogs (which have stealth detection). Hug the wall and walk into the next courtyard, keeping to the right and avoiding patrols with dogs in them. Sneak past the ogre group around the corner, and continue forwards until you reach the plant mobs. Sneak up the ramp and to the middle of the area. Loot the chest for the key, and walk to and through the door at the far north end of the courtyard. Continue down the corridor, into the room beyond and take to the left. Up the ramp, and the flame is just to the left. Be careful of the patrolling Eye, since it will probably see you standing by the flame when it comes past.\
\
+ All guards can be killed for loot (vendor or Large Brilliant Shards, plus DM books). Just be careful to pull them away from nearby mobs, since they call for help and enrage when reaching low hp. A tailorer or leatherworker may enjoy a Gordok Shackle Key which leads to http://www.wowhead.com/?item=18250.\
\
Straholme (scarlet):\
Use the main entrance. Stealth past the first group of mobs to be greeted by a wall of see-through-stealth zombies on an appropriate moment (the zombies move around, some patrol). Hug the left side, and jump over the stairs of the first building. Continue hugging the left wall until the corner, from here walk in the middle between the mob groups, watch out for patrolling Patchwork Horrors and  zombies. Walk up the the gate. A druid can run in, pop barkskin and Hurricane the rats, a rogue could do it with a grenade. It's also possible simply to single kill every rat, or start in stealth, pop dash/spring and run through - you get out on the other side before it closes, after which the summoned rats will start patrolling in packs. After the gate, run between the packs up front to the other side (*), turn left and hug the wall. Stealth into the scarlet area and touch the flame.\
\
+ Hearthsinger Forresten (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=10558) has one of his spawnpoints @ (*). Kill if there/you want.\
+ After touching the fire you might want to massacre the area for possible Righteous Orb(s) or BoE dungeon set 1 pieces. This will also spawn Timmy(!).\

After entering, immediately jump down to the left, hugging the wall. Open the Iron Gate (kicks you out of stealth, make sure the patrols are heading away from you or are far away). Restealth, walk over to the doorway to the left and into The Great Ossuary. Jump down the first hole to the left, sneak across the room to somewhere near the door and wait until the mobs have moved aside enough for you to pull Rattlegore. Kill him, loot the Viewing Room key and sneak back up the stairs and back to the room you first jumped down into. Walk and jump into the corner by the Viewing Room door and open the door. It's possible without pulling the mobs, just stand as far into the corner you can while still reaching the door. Restealth, sneak into the viewing room and touch the flame.\
\
+ The Scholomance key is probably the hardest (and rarest) of the old dungeon keys to get. It's a far run, but you you can take off your gear and kite a melee mob from Sorrow Hill to the entrance of Scholomance. Druids have the easiest time doing this, use r1 moonfire. Die, ghostrun through the door, ressurect. Or, get help from a keyholder.\
\
Blackrock Spire:\
After entering, sneak across the room to the right, jump down. Head into the corridor (watch out for the patrol) and immediately when you come out on the other side, take right and jump down. Jump down to the next out sticking ledge, and then down onto the floor. Sneak through the \"corridor\" of orcs, and then up the area with spiders. Be mindful of the patrols and Mother Smolderweb. When you reach Mother Smolderweb, jump up on the beam and sneak across past the spiders. After you've cleared them, head up to the ogres. Walk through the group, stand on the edge and touch the flame.\
\
Enjoy.\

\
The Scholomance flame is in the Viewing Room.  You must kill Rattlegore to obtain the key to enter the viewing room.  Can be done solo by some, but not all.\
\
The Dire Maul flame is located in Dire Maul north.  This can also be solo'd by stealth classes.  You can find the flame located past the tribute run widget freeze trap just up the ramp in the ogre tanin room.\
\
The Stratholme flame is found in the living side (SM Strat) in the same room you fight Timmy in.  This flame can only be reached with a group or careful stealthing.\
\
The Blackrock Spire flame is found just after mother smolder thorn.  You will walk up a ramp to a ledge with several ogres, and you can't miss the flame.  Be careful of ogres.\

\
Lower Blackrock Spire:\
This is easy up to Mother Smolderweb. To get to her, run past the first few groups until you enter the main spire. Jump down from the right side of the first platform to reach a walkway that leads to the \"orc alley\". Run past them and blink past the last group before Mother Smolderweb. Here you should use one Invisibility to get past the first spider group, then wait 5 minutes at the upper walkway and use another Invisibility to get past the second group. Run past the ogres and polymorph the closest one to the flame if you have to. Jump down to the walkway you used earlier and teleport out.\
\
Dire Maul North:\
There are some packs of AoEable critters on the opposite side of the first room. Get rid of them and find the spot where the wall has collapsed and there's a big pile of dirt next to it. Pull Guard Mol'dar and run back to the collapsed wall. When he gets close, jump to the pile of dirt and he turns around and tries to find an alternate path to you. Jump back and hit him when he is in range. Jump back to the pile of dirt. Repeat until he's dead and loot the courtyard key from him. Continue to the courtyard, avoiding any patrols and groups. As a rule, caster ogres are easy since you resist most of their spells, so if you have to fight, polymorph a melee ogre and kill the casters first. Use the key and open the courtyard door. Kill the two ogre packs and the AoEable critters before the frost trap. Use Invisibility and run up to the platform where the tannin (and the flame) is. Teleport out.\
\
Scarlet Stratholme:\
Enter through the main entrance. AoE the first pack. Use Invisibility and avoid the ghouls, they can see you. You should barely have time to reach the trapped portcullis on the left. AoE the rats and wait for your Invisibility cooldown. Use an another Invisibility to reach the Crusaders' Square. Wait for your Invisibility cooldown or kill the first two Scarlets to reach the flame. Teleport out.\
\
Scholomance:\
Kill the first few skeletons and the patrols if you need to. Avoid the humanoids, they have a relatively small aggro radius. Keep opening the iron gates and head towards Rattlegore. Polymorph the whelp handlers and AoE the whelps. You should at most be fighting 3-5 whelps at a time. Clear the whole whelp room. Proceed to Rattlegore's room and kill the adds one by one. When both Rattlegore's room and the whelp room are empty, fire at Rattlegore and run up. Head to the furthest pit and keep casting Fireblasts / Ice Lances while Rattlegore tries to catch you. When he does, jump down. Now you have some time for a bandage or an Evocation. When Rattlegore runs back down, blink past him and run back up to the pit. Repeat until Rattlegore is dead. A Water Elemental is handy here, since it can keep firing while you are running. Loot the Viewing Room key from Rattlegore. Open the iron gate leading to the Viewing Room and go back to the entrance of Scholmance. Carefully manouver yourself to the edge of the bridge and fire at one of the magic-immune skeletons next to the door. Since you opened all of the iron gates, he should start running through Scholomance to reach you, along with his buddies. When he does, jump down, open the door with your Viewing Room key and use Invisibility. Touch the flame and teleport out.",
    "9319109445201094452007/06/22 16:58:24AngraJust soloed it as a warrior (arms-fury with decent gear).\
\
Scholo part is by far the easiest and fastest. I killed just like 20 monsters including Rattlegore. Most packs can be avoided, even in that room with little dragonkins where I killed just one pack. Skellies have stun => more life and rage from Second Wind talent. Actually their stun worked better than my bandages.\
\
LBRS is easy too. Packs of orcs aren't that hard and some of them also can be avoided, and Mother Smolderweb has skill that activates Second Wind as well. Only problem is two packs with two elite spiders and few non-elites, but still manageable without too much problem.\
\
Stratholme is hardest part I'd say. Packs aren't easy and it is impossible (or very difficult) to avoid them. I killed like 40+ mobs in there on my way to the flame. But real problem are Ghouls. They got debuff that slows your health regeneration by 100% for 10 minutes, plus you getting 150 damage every 10 seconds in the duration of debuff. This debuff means you won't get any benefits from eating, so you just have to wait these 10 minutes until it ends. There are few ghouls patrolling between regular packs of skellies and zombies, some of them can be avoided but not all.\
Rats are annoying as well since warriors aren't really good in AoE. Whirlwind and thunderclap will help you, but prepare for quite long and boring fight. As soon as you skip skellies, it is done. You'll have to kill just two scarlet to get to flame.\
\
Dire Maul isn't really difficult, just watch around for patrols. Packs in courtyard are quite strong but those are only you have to kill. I killed one of the Guards (one who need to be freezed) because he got aggroed when I was busy killing one of the packs. Spent recklessness on him and super healing potion (I was on 35% when he attacked me).\
\
This quest seems like a challenge for a warrior. I've missed this event last year so I decided to spend few hours to do this quest. Really enjoyed doing it, was fun.\
\
Good luck with the quest, hope this information will be useful for you *waves*",

    "9319109897301098972007/06/23 14:27:17NechromOne-manned this with my lvl 70 hunter.\
\
The only mobs I ever had to kill was some of Rattlegore's adds and ofc Rattlegore himself.\
\
As a hunter, you would probably gain most from going through the alternative entrance to Strat (undead side) to avoid the rat-trap, most of the skeleton and ghoul packs have such a low aggro radius that you can sneak past them along the walls, and when you do pull them, go to your closest safe-spot and feign death.\
\
In Dire Maul it's much harder to get past the mobs without aggroing them, so be ready to run and feign alot. But aside from that there's nothing fancy.\
\
In LBRS you only need to run and feign at the last orcs before the spiders, at the first spider group (before Smolderweb) and at the last spider group. Everything else is possible to sneak past without aggroing, including Smolderweb.\
\
Scholo is pretty straight forward. Jump down from the balcony before the first gate, run to the small stairs and feign. Avoid the patrols in the big room past the gate and hug the left wall in the whelp room and try to time the whelp and handler movements as you move forward. No killing or feigning needed. When you get to Rattlegore's room, pull his adds one by one and kill as many as you want to, so you feel comfortable pulling Rattlegore. The adds should be auto-shotted until they enrage in order for your pet to build aggro so you can nuke them when they enrage. As a BM hunter this should be alot easier than it was for me as MM, but just so you know you don't have to be BM.\
Rattlegore is pretty easy, he does some low dps attacks and stuns your pet. Just manage your aggro and feign if he stuns your pet and ofc you should have mend pet ticking all the time (duh).\
After you get the key from Rattlegore, head back to the stairs leading down to the room with the viewing room door. Wait for the \"spiders\" to pass and then run to the center of the room. Every mob in that room has very low aggro radius, including the spider patrols so you should be able to avoid them and make your way to the other side of the room. Hugging that wall and going to your right (towards the viewing room door) behind those big-ass candelabra in the corner, sneak close enough to the door so you can unlock it. The skeletons and ghouls shouldn't aggro and you can make it past them through the door without them noticing, but if they do you have lots of space to feign on inside the viewing room.\
\
I never used anything that not all lvl 70 hunters have. You could probably make it through the rat trap with Improved Barrage and engineering grenades, but it's not needed if you have the Strat gate-key. But if you have neither I suggest stripping your gear before going into the rat trap to \"disarm\" it, then just release and run back.\
\
Please reply if you have any questions regarding doing this as a lvl 70 hunter.",

However when you die, the baddies don't disappear, they hang around waiting for you to claim your corpse, so if you're patient and don't mind dying, you can focus-fire, kill one, die, return, kill another, die, and then take out the last two, which is how I did it.\

No major issues killing the Khan 1-on-1 thanks to disarm - he's a pushover without his axe.\

\
The first two waves are easy, but it would have gone a lot faster with some more thought. MAKE SURE YOUR PET ATTACKS BEFORE YOUR TRAPS GO OFF.\
\
First Wave: Place a freezing trap and kill whichever doesn't get frozen. Fire a single shot at the second one, then allow your pet to kill it while you regain mana. sometime before it dies, throw down another trap and heal your pet.\
\
Second Wave: After your first trap goes off, lay another one. Kill whichever centaur isn't frozen. If the advisor becomes unfrozen at any time, make sure to focus fire them. Just pick them off as best you can. Don't bother with the freezing trap while you kill the last one, as the third wave will stop at the bottom of the ramp to the horn and walk up slowly.\
\
Third Wave: Place a trap when you see the third wave coming up. You should get the Khan. Attack the advisor first. Activate Rapid Fire and burn down  your pets targets as fast as possible, and keep healing up on your pet throughout. If you can, attempt to move the fight towards the bottom of the ramp. If the Khan becomes free, freeze him again. If your pet dies at any time, feign death, rez your pet, and try again. Once all three escorts are dead, bring the Khan to the horn. Take your pet's growl off, and if your pet has hate, dps until he targets you. Now, lay a frost trap next to the horn. This is the fun part. Now you just continue kiting the Khan in circles around the horn until he's dead.\
\
That's my guide for hunters, I'll try and update as I level my other characters.",

\
Blow the horn, the first two waves are easy and shouldn't be a problem for any class around level 40.  When Khan Hratha starts coming, focus your first DPS on the Advisor who heals.  Kill the advisor, get pounded by the others, and corpse run. Return, the mobs should still be available to kill. I used a frost shock kiting method on the Khan, and focused damage on the other two adds while kiting down the ramp. If you can use a slowing ability on the Khan to kite him, while dps'ing the adds you should be able to get both non-elites down.

Ok so now just focus on the boss, mortal strike, heroic strike etc, don't bother wasting rage using whirlwind, cleave etc as it is unlikely that you will kill the other two at this level (41), you probably could kill them if the potion had cooled down, in my case it had not, hopefully the boss should be dead, when he's down quickly loot him for the quest item and you will probably be near your death as I was, at this time you may want to try finishing them off if you feel you have a chance, you could also try hamstringing them to aid your escape, if all else fails I advise jumping off the cliff as I did so you don't have to run all the way up to retrieve your corpse.",

\
On the first wave (two mobs), sap one and kill the other.\
\
On the second wave (three mobs), distract one near the base of the ramp, and the other two will continue walking. Sap one and kill the other once they are out of range of the distracted mob. If the distracted one continues up the ramp after distract wears off, kill him and then the sapped one. Sometimes though, it will stop at the ramp, and you can kill the sapped one first.\
\
On the third wave (three mobs and the elite), ideally distract the three non-elite mobs and take out the elite with a lot of stuns. If you do this, bring the elite up near the horn, because the pack of three will usually stop a little bit before the horn after distract wears off. You still have sap and blind if some mobs get through.\

In order to blow it you need to get the mouthpiece which has a very low drop rate (about 1%), so expect to be killing Centaur's for quite a long time.\
\
Once the horn has been blown you will face 3 waves of enemies.  The first attack is two Maraudine Khan Guard's.  The second attack is two more Khan Guard's along with a Maraudine Khan Advisor who will heal the other two if you don't kill her first.  The final attack will be Khan Hratha who is an elite with two Khan Guard's and an Advisor.  \

\
Good players make their own luck. Having reached Exalted by doing Strat 45 runs (with ZG blues) with ~10 minutes to spare, it boils down to:\
\
1) Group buildup. Tank and primary Healer are the obvious. We mostly opted for a two mage team, with some melee DPS to wrap things up. Warrior will duel wield most of the time, using 1H+Shield when fighting multiple mobs and/or mob type.\
\
2) Crowd-control. Priests are always healing, so they'll never shackle. But having two Frost Novas for spamming during four mob pulls is critical. Three are pinned to the floor, allowing the group to kill one mob that is extracted from the group.\
\
3) Fast pulling (and counterspell from Mage), but one that allows a slight pause between kill/re-entering combat: this allows drinking (even if of small amounts). Most pulls are from the Warrior, but some are better if they are sheep pulls,\
\
4) Fixed pulling order. You aren't pulling all of the mobs, and we had our mob pulls numbered. Our path is different than the one below, but it gives you a good idea of the notion of mob avoidance.\
http://www.wowwiki.com/Image:Baron45.jpg\
\
5) Use line-of-sight to move mobs to kill locations. Depends on your pathing.\
\
6) Mage solos a Ziggurat. Once the group kills Baroness Anastari, four players continue to clear to Nerub while a mage solos the zigg. Mage will solo the trap, while the group is killing Nerub, and then solo the zigg. Mage will solo zigg on Maleki while group is clearing to the abomination gates. This buys us time.\
\
6) Cleaner. Put the loot in FFA, and have a enchanter shift-click on everything. Each one of us made ~70g minimum per run by disenchanting everything that was looted.\
\
This quest is one of the greatest challenges in the game. It has more to do with skill and teamplay, than with gear.",
    "89451467610146762006/12/13 06:16:43kreghxWent to try a 45min run yesterday. \
\
We were: \
\
1 Paladin \
1 Mage \
1 Hunter \
1 Warrior \
1 Rogue (who left just before Nerub'enkan) \
\
So we did this from Nerub forth with only 4 ppl. \
\
Had a wipe due to fears after the trap by nerub. Corpse ran. \
\
Rest went smoothly, hunter kept pulling. \
\
Had 8 Minutes left when we reached Ramstein ^^. \
\
Smashed the zombies and skels, then went in. \
\
Mage and hunter went into barons room, and pet obviously ran off to kill baron by himself (Gotta love pet bugs) So door closed right in front of me (warrior) and pally. Mage and hunter died, and we were like oh noes :D. Well baron didn't kill Ysida (probably since whole group didn't get killed) And with 3 minutes left on the timer we ressed Mage and Hunter. \
\
Attacked Baron with a good 2 minutes to go. Took him down np. \
\
So what i'm saying is, this quest is not too hard, if it is doable with 4 ppl, including 1 full wipe + corpse run, and a screwup at baron. \
\
Needless to say, Mage and Hunter had pretty good gear (Hell my gear isn't that bad, and im arms specced, even tho I was at 15% in damage meter, and they were both at about 40ish) \
\
Also paladin had nice gear, had around 5,5k mana (almost never went under 4k tho :P) Since the dps output was huge, mobs went down really fast. \
\
btw, didn't tank, I just went full out dps shouting + hamstring stuff to let mage and hunter do their job. (Bosses I did tank tho) \
\
oh one more thing, after we killed bosses at the ziggurats, we continued while mage ran in to clear them. Saved about 1-2mins per zig. \
\
Yeah that's about it. We did it the 'normal' way, meaning Baroness -> Nerub'enkan -> Maleki -> Ramstein -> Baron. (skipped magistrate and all unnecessary mobs). I must say, we didn't even hurry that much. I personally didn't think this would go this easy, But I guess the dps was just too awesome. \

\
In order to pull this off successfully, you need to know how to cut the right corners:\
\
1. you do not need (or want) to pull every group of mobs that you would normally pull on a Strat dead run.  Walk around every group you possibly can.  Battle the fewest number of enemies possible.\
\
2. do not loot anything (except - maybe! - for the minibosses).  You do not have the time to roll for random greens, but more importantly, if it takes you 3s to loot a mob and you loot 100 over the course of the run, that's 5 full minutes used.  The timer is too tight to justify 5 minutes of looting.\
\
3. start the next pull before the current mob is dead.  The DPS players (specifically rogues and hunters) should basically have no downtime throughout the run.  The only breaks you should take are for the casters to drink up, and even then you should only drop out of combat long enough for them to start.\
\
4. most importantly and most obviously, remember to concentrate your firepower on a single target before moving onto the next one.  That actually applies to every group, but people seem to forget easily.\
\
Unfortunately a good part of this run is luck.  With that said, best of luck to you.  :)",

    "763694701094702006/12/07 19:37:23wutaioI found personally the best strategy for all the bosses are having a warlock close for blood pact and health stones, a priest for resurrecting incase you die to increase amount of tries before despawn, and a hunter with track humans on to watch for opposing factions to despawn the demon intentionally.  It is also very important that your group watches for additional mobs and aggros them with a single shot and kite them away from your path one additional mob can equal game over.\
\
Solenor- The best strategy used for solenor I foudn was the set of ruins of the AQ gates by the western part of his path. Spawn him and kite him up the ruins, wingclip him at the  middle of the ramp to the East of the ruins near where you spawn him. At the topmost edge wingclip again and jump down.  (This forces the bugs to walk around and you can easily turn and pelt him with auto shot and AOe the bugs with volley when they do come.  Repeat this tactic from level to level until you are back on the ground and repeat usually by time your back on the ground he is almost dead.",
    "76364793610479362007/03/07 22:14:52SeksAs of patch 2.0.10, the quest is still bugged (see notes above).\
\
Additionally, you can still kill the demons in humanoid form and be able to loot the heads. This benefits the hunter in two ways:\
\
1) Solenor will not fear you nor spawn bugs. I was able to kite him easily without any shadow protection pots or a curse of recklessness on me.\
\
2) Attempting the demons in humanoid form will not reset their 15 min timer. You can attempt them over and over again without fear of them despawning.\
\
I haven't tested if having a friend helping you dps the demon in humanoid form is possible.",
    "76361273720127372006/12/10 12:17:10HownowSolenor - A nice little tip for Solenor is when he starts off, drop a explosive trap and have him run into that. Then wing clip him and bolt outta there. The trap should to AoE damage to everything around him, and if you have curse of Recklessness on you, you shouldnt need to worry about the fears, so for the time the explosive trap lasts, you should have no problem with the bugs either. Just unload into him for when you can, but be sure you have a few mana pots on you and a shadow protection pot on you to keep the damage off you. Once the bugs start poping, and your trap wears off, when he's wing cliped git up volley rank 1 when you have all the bugs in a group. this should finish off the little suckers with use of the least mana as possible. This guy was the biggest pain for me personally, but that really just depends on what you're good at.\
\
Artorius - The main problem you WILL run into here, is getting around corners, and mana. So, when you start a turn, any turn at all, be sure to hit him in the face with a concussive shot, but dont get too far ahead of him in the process. Also, keep rank 1 arcane shot out like Kaenos said, and hit him with that every now and then between serpent stings to stay on his aggro list. I only shot him with the sting once every 3-5 seconds, because if you spam him, it will only stack up to 5 times, and your just wasting mana. The main thing to remember here besides the wait time on serpent sting is that rank 9 serpent sting DOESN'T work. One of my guildmates found this out the hard way, and only did minimal damage to him. This may have been updated in 2.0.1, but to the best of my knowledge, stick to sting rank 8. \
\
Simone - Basically easy to kill, i got her pet down first, and the killed her, but as long as you have nature protection pots and some mana pots on you just in case, you should be able to kite her around, even without killing her pet if you want to. Having another hunter follow you around with aspect of nature on is really good, because that allows you to keep aspect of the hawk on, which can really add to your DPS.\
\
Klinfran - Best thing to use here is rank one for wing clip. It gets the job done without wasting mana. The strat here can really be based on your weapon speed. Since each weapon has a specific attack speed (2.4s or whatever) once you scorpid sting him, you run up and attack him for 10 seconds. Your weapon can help time this, because if you have a 2.0 second attack speed, just hit him 5 times, wing clip and start running away. Try not to use raptor strike, because this fight is gonna be the longest one, and you will need the mana. When the fight starts off, hit him with concussive shot, frost trap, whatever you got to slow him down, and once he enrages hit him with scorpid. Then, start the attack cycle of running up, hitting him so many times, wing clip, run away, wait for enrage, and hit him with scorpid sting again. From there rince and repeat for roughly 7-10 minutes. Keep some mana pots with you for this fight specifically, and be sure to have a tuber or two for some health incase you slip up and he nails you once or twice. when you get far enough away from him after wing clipping him, you can hit him with an auto shot or two to add to some damage, but never try to aimed shot him. Also, don't use counterattack if it comes up. Imp wingclip can be helpful, but keep in mind you need to wait 10 seconds after you wing clip him for the enrage to come back up, and if you counterattack him, hes only stuck in place for 4 seconds, so he will be charging at you for 6 seconds, until he enrages, which most likely means hes gonna enrage within your minimum range. The most useful thing to use if this does happen though is scatter shot, then get away from him and hit him with a scorpid sting. You might get hit once or twice, but you should be able to survive 2-3 hits, and then just pick up where you left off and learn from your mistakes.",

\
Be dueling a warlock that you trust immensely while fighting Solenor, if you can keep him wing clipped, have aspect of the cheetah up at all times, you don't have to kill beetles. The reasoning for the warlock is for Curse of Recklessness (no fearing from Solenor). \
\
Simone's pet doesn't need to be killed, but you need to loot her head before he kills you.\
\
For Klinfran, if you are specced for Scatter Shot, you can kite to different ends of the Burning Steppes then use Scatter Shot and go the other way. He is leashed to only Burning Steppes, so no Redridge/BRM.",

The mobs don't call for help. If you are not careful the scouts will run to the nearest guardpost and get help. The scouts did not start doing this until after I had gotton the tablets and Hameya's key.\
\
Most of the mobs can passed without aggroing any of them.\
\
BIGGEST TIP: Don't run through the graveyard in the central area at the bottom of the stairs of the temple. Infected Mossflayers will spawn everywhere. Make your way around one of the sides and jump over the wall at the bottom.\
\
At the base of the temple just to the right of the stairs the fourth tablet is resting against the bottom tier wall. A lvl 59 Shadowhunter is channeling next to it. He can be killed without aggro from other mobs.\

The third tablet as at the top of the temple on the left resting against the low wall. You can acquire this tablet without getting aggro from the channeler near it.",

Since you technically need his recipes to complete these quests, it's fair to call his quests a prereq.\
\
Nevertheless, carefully consider the cost of all three quests in this line and check the AH for which path is cheaper (buying the armor vs making the armor yourself)\
\
All told you need:\
\
Mithril Coif x2\
Ornate Mithril Shoulder\
Heavy Mithril Breastplate x2\
Ornate Mithril Gloves\
Heavy Mithril Boots x2\
Ornate Mithril Pants\
\
To make all the armor yourself you need the total ingredients listed here:\
\
Mithril Bar x106\
Truesilver Bar x 3\
Mageweave Cloth x 18\
Thick Leather x 14\
Solid Grinding Stone x 3\
\
I strongly suggest you do the math for your realm's AH prices. Often it is significantly cheaper to buy the armor pieces than to make it yourself.",

There are two really big trees near him, close to the water.  Cleared out the gorillas first so no adds, turned on Aspect of the Pack so the mage and I could keep ahead of him, fire mage switched to Frostbolt to help keep him slow and for mana efficiency and to keep aggro on me.  Growl disabled on pet so it would just dps and not pull aggro from me.  Then ran loops and figure 8's around the trees for a few minutes, slowly dps'ing him down.

A few posts above, a poster mentions two large trees he figure 8'd around to kill him.\

What I ended up doing was just get aggro on myself, send my pet in to attack him(without growl) and just kited him around the larger of the two trees w/ aspect of the pack. If you manage to get a decent bit ahead of him around said tree, he'll actually turn around and head to you that way. If you're smart, you can abuse this a few times, make him go back and forth, before having to do a few more rounds.\
\
All I did really was put serpent sting on him, get a bit inhead, and do an auto shot. Run ahead more, another autoshot, rinse, repeat, and reapply Serpent when it's about to fall off.\
\
He also does a small AoE that will probably hit your pet a few times. It doesn't hurt much, but besure to watch your pet's health and use Mend when needed.\

Only had to use 2 greater mana potions. I probably could have done it with none in a few more tries as I used Conq shot and arcane shot several times aswell throughout.",

Pirate Hats Ahoy! (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8365), because you have to go to the same place for all of them. There's really no need to worry about the trip just South of Steamwheedle Port to Lost Rigger Cove, because the shore's just lined with neutral 41-44 tortoise until you get closer to Lost Rigger Cove, where you run into some of the Pirates. Being a 48 druid, it was really easy to just prowl past everything until I got to the first 2-story building on my right after I went past the little arch thing that leads to the main part of Lost Ringer Cove. When you first walk in, there's 3 pirates, and for me, their levels were 44, 45, and another 44 (but it probably varies). It's a good idea to kill the 3 bobos here. Then, you walk up a small staircase, and there's 3 more pirates, levels of 45, 45, and 44 for me. If you try to pull them one at a time here, they'll all aggro, so be ready for combat! I tried prowling past, but I aggroed. Then there's a larger double staircase, and taking that, you get to the second story, where the Stoley's Shipment is (on the left wall for me). It's a little obvious----it glows like when your computer's telling you that you can loot something (there's like 4 or 5 stacks of Stoley's Shipment, but you can only take one).

So, basically, you can run back and forth, kill him over and over again, and get this quest done in no time. \
My drop rate was 11/13, or 85%. \
I would've gotten ALL of my crystals from him, had I known he had such a great respawn/drop rate! Have a hunter with you and he's easily \
trackable when he respawns.",

Another mob boss that's been removed from the wowhead database for some weird reason.\
Anyway, just did it solo on my lvl 66 protection warrior. Had to use all cooldowns (including dodge and armor trinkets),Shield Wall, healing pots, shield absorber, protection and strength potion and a cooking meal that increased stamina by 20.\
Just barely made it, got like 200 hp left. I noticed that Devastate really helped in this battle. Get his armor, attack power and attack speed down, then spam all the skills that are up like crazy.\

He's immune to fear, stuns, spellinterupts and silence, so don't waste time on using those.\

Then he goes on saying that 'before the Scarab Gate opens', they need to do the scepter quests (which is also correct).\
\
You're right that the Calling is not part of the scepter-series, but you do have to do the Calling to even start the rest.\

Either way, both your posts are old, and the recent changes (as others have posted) have made this easily soloable at 70, probably at 60 as well. But might be nice to keep correct info here for future new servers where some might want to take part of this (for whatever reason).",

Based on comments from various sources I chose the Diamond Flask. Needless to say, I regretted that choice. I was a Fury warrior and shoulders with +hit are very rare. I only managed to get nice +hit shoulders with the Epic lvl 60 pvp shoulders.\
\
Diamond Flask is ok, but you will definitely find better dps trinkets along the way to 60. IMO, the shoulders are pricless. I even wanted to have a GM change them for me once, but decided not to, as there was limited item restore for characters.\

\
After freeing Bly several waves of level 42-45 trolls spawn at the bottom of the steps (some but not all elite). It is best to wait at the top of the steps and kill each wave of spawns as they come to you, because if you go down the steps you may agro additional trolls. If you toggle pvp on you will get heals from the orc npc priest, but they won't usually save you from dying. After fighting several waves of trolls Bly leads you down the steps and you fight the two bosses. Neither are particularly difficult, though you do fight both at once so make sure to off-tank one of them. \
\
Once the bosses are killed you can talk to the goblin who will blow up the gates to Chief Ukorz Sandscalp. Do not talk to Bly until everybody is ready, because doing so causes Bly and his group to agro and attack you. Kill off the priest and lock first, then the rogue and finally Bly himself. Loot his body for the divino-matic rod and the quest is complete. \

If you equip this item in your trinket slot, it will drain both your mana and your hp until you either remove the item or you die.

Go to Ironforge.\
Find the First Aid Trainer Nissa; she is in a shop right across from the gryphon landing in the great forge area.\
Get the quest from her to go to Theramore and visit Dr Gustov.\
Travel to Theramore; likely to the Wetlands and then to Theramore by ship.\
Once in Theramore go to the keep; northwest portion of the city if I recall; once you come out of the docks take the pathway to the right; follow it to the warrior training area; then go right to get to the entrance.\
Once into the keep; go right, then left, he is in the room in the back right corner of the keep.\
Go to Dr Gustov and get the quest.\
\
Key requirement is to save 15 injured all the while you will have injured dying - just cant let more than 6 die.\
\
Now here are the tricks:\
- Press the \"v\" key.  This will show a title and status bar over all the injured soldiers.  This makes it easy to see which soldiers are critical, badly or just injured.\
- Step forward through the Dr so you have your character's back to the doctor; from this position you will be able to select and heal the patients without moving around.\
- Use the bandages the Dr gives you.\
\
Now at first I was confused and wasted alot of time looking for critically injured soldiers - initially there won't be any - only badly injured and injured soldiers.  Just work on the Badly injured first.\
- Now select a soldier and heal him with the bandages - good idea to put the bandages on a hot key spot just for the quest.  The healing takes about 5 seconds for each patient; so it is slow.\
- Use the time while you are healing wisely.  Use it to look around for other patients.  Find the Critically and Badly injured soldiers if there are any.  While you are healing one soldier you can select your next patient.  Once you finish healing one you should have the next one selected and this allows you to press your hot key and imediately start healing the next soldier.  Believe me - every little bit of time you can take advantage of will help. \

\
You must level your Engineering Skill up to 225. \
When you have made your decision, go to Tanaris and head east out of Gadgetzan. \
When you reach \"Steamwheedle Port\" head north, and just outside of town there is a small hut, \
kind of 'magical' looking, inside you will find a Gnome, wearing a purple turban and a table with a book on top of it. \
Right click on the book \"Soothesaying for Dummies\" and select one of the two options.\
(something along the lines of..)\
1. \"I am absolutely sure I wish to specialize in Goblin Engineering.\"\
2. \"I am absolutely sure I wish to specialize in Gnomish Engineering.\"\
You will see a message saying \"You have learned a new skill: (Gnomish/Goblin) Engineering\

Done! \

From there, you can summon the boss that you must kill to pick up the Abyssal Scepter.\
Note that the boss requires at least 20 decent-geared players to be downed.\

The ring is blue and provides nice NR for the various dungeons that utilize nature damage.\
However, you might just want to pick up a Jasper Link of Nature Resistance (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=11978) off the AH for an amount of gold depending on your server.\

I believe there is at least 1 more location at 35:18, but I have not been there so I don't know what guards it or the exact location. It took 2 people for us to do this and it was just doable, Shadow Priest and Feral Druid (tank) both level 57.\

\
1) In the bottom of the tower were two Tortured Sentinels ( http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=12179 ), each of which spawned a Hive'Ashi Drone ( http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=13136 ) when it was killed.\
2) Food and drink time.\
3) On entering the tower at the bottom three more Drones spawned.\
4) Food, drink, and wait for cooldowns to finish.\
5) At the top of the tower two Drones spawned when the goo was collected.\
6) Dropped to the bottom and there were some more mobs but at this point I legged it so no idea what they were.\
\
In all for me, two lvl57s and seven lvl58s. Note though that the mobs could have been a level lower and the sentinels don't always spawn a drone when they're killed. Note alse that at the top of the tower there is bugger all room to maneuver - I ran into one corner with mobs chasing to frost nova then ran to the opposite which was just out of melee range of the drones.",

You will receive a box with the jars in them. If you are having inventory troubles (full inventory, etc) leave them in the box until you are ready to do the quest. After you open the box, you will receive 2 sets of 6 jars. One set for the Tainted Ooze, one set for the Cursed Ooze.\

The Tainted Ooze can be found at the two ponds in Jaedenar. The coordinates are 40, 59 and 40, 55 for those two ponds.\

The Cursed Ooze can be found just south of there at two other ponds. The coordinates for those two ponds are 40, 67 and 40, 71.\

After you kill the Oozes, be sure to loot them. Then, select their dead \"body\" and use the appropriate container (Cursed or Tainted, depending on what you just killed) to fill the jar with ooze.\

Just downed the drake as 56-shadow priest with 900-mana and 1045 hp left. Not too tough, for other shadow priests out there 50+ should be no problem. Shield, then use innerfocus then mind blast to begin the battle. When he begins to cast his flame breath, immediately silence him (cannot remember if immune).Just keep him dotted and mind flay him down back-to-back, do not wand unless out of mana. When shield fades, re-shield as soon as possible, that split second hesitation could cost a chunk of health you may need. Dont forget to use pots if you can! \
