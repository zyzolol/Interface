Also, using a pet to pull the mob to guards seems to yield some... unexpected results. Regardless, if you run to the friendly guards with Heindel fighting your pet, as long as *you* are near the guards, they will aggro your pet's target (assuming pet attack is on), even if the pet is still quit far (and yes, you can make the guards come back too, by giving pet follow command, it's kind of fun). ^^",

\
What you do is this: (I did this as lvl 36 warrior and didn't even sweat about it, I assume anyone at lvl 28-30 could do it)\
\
Before you accept this quest, pull a swamp mob or two into the guards. They will be very busy. Accept the quest and strafe or back to the nearest tower. If you don't keep hitting Hendel, he will drop you and run back to the camp. When you get close to the tower, the guards there will assist you. When Hendel reaches about 25% health, he will give up and run back to the camp. If the guards there are still aggroed at you, pull them towards the tower as well, let the guards there deal with them. \

WoW Version : 2.3\
Player Level : 28 (protection/holy paladin)\
Method : Solo\
\
1) Pull a mob into the camp (I used a Withervine Ripper from across the road).\
2) The guards at Hendel's camp will aggro against the mob and defend you.  Stop attacking the mob, and wait for the guards to knock the mob down to roughly 25% health.\
3) Talk to Private Hendel and accept quest to subdue him.  Start fighting Hendel.\
4) When the guards finish off the mob above, they will turn on Hendel and finish him off for you.  Once the guards begin with Hendel, you really only need to worry about keeping yourself alive.  When the gaurds took over, I did nothing offensive and simply healed myself as Hendel does not aggro to guards, he will remain focused on you.\
5) Once subdued, the guards stop attacking and reset, Lady Proudmoore shows up, along with Archmage Tervosh.  When quest is complete, talk to Tervosh as soon as you can.\
6) After completing quest, if you respond quickly, you can also turn in the final quest to Lady Proudmoore before she disappears back to her tower.\
\
I never really fell below 50% health while Hendel was attacking me.  This method works great.  Other classes may have a bit more difficulty taking direct hits from Hendel, but the overall strategy above should work for everyone (in my opinion).\

It's not such a pain if you take the opportunity to do these other quests first before returning back to Theramore. The swamp is also a heaven for Herbalists; well worth a visit just for this fact. There's also some iron and mithril to be found here; particulary in the Murloc cave to the southeast between Stonard and the ocean shore.\

Watcher Biggs (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=5476) sits a little south of the road that leads forks off down to the Blasted Lands and to Stonard. He offers a short quest chain, one part of which also takes you to the beach, so to save time you do the first two parts of his chain before going for the crab legs.\

Galen Goodward (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=5391) sits in a cage at the easternmost edge of the Broken encampment (Fallow Sanctuary). He wants to be escorted out of there, but unfortunately he also wants to be escorted through pretty much the densest part of the encampment. Bring friends or he'll die (though he can be buffed/healed). Do this quest when Biggs sends you here to look for his lost junk.\
\
Be sure to stumble upon Noboru the Cudgel. (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=5477) He patrols around the middle-ish section of the swamp with two escorts and drops an item that starts another quest.\
\
There are also crates scattered around the swamp that can be looted for another quest-starting item. Take this item, run/ride back to Darkshire just after you finish Biggs' quest chain and find the NPC near the town center standing next to the eastern road that wants you to take a crate to the castle in Blasted Lands to turn in another three quests.\

In Search of the Temple, also in Stormwind from a dwarf in the bar in the Dwarf quarter. You find him through the door immediately to your right when entering the Dorf quarter when coming from the direction of the Keep. His friend standing nearby hands out quests to the Deadmines by the way.\

Ledger from Tanaris, starts at the wooden outhouse in Searing Gorge. (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4450) Be sure to be level 43 and bring 15 Silk Cloth before going there.\

You only have to harvest crystals from the big crystal formations found throughout the Draeni village called The Fallow Sanctuary.  It's the area in the north-northeast of the zone.  I found that the Draeni character models blend VERY well with the surrounding swamp, so what looks like an easy one-on-one kill can become two-on-one or even three-on-one.  It doesn't help that the mobs are level 37-38.\
\
If you have the patience and want to play it extremely safe, you will usually find one or two crystal formations with only one nearby mob.  Just loot those and wait on a respawn.\
\
Due to the fact that the Draeni blend in, and they tend to run when their health is low, you can end up with some very nasty fights, so it's not a bad idea to bring one or two friends for backup.\
\
You can accomplish much more than this quest in this area, though.  If you are allied with the Gelkis centaur in Desolace, one of their later quests sends you to retrieve a gem from Ongeku, who is found in the northwestern part of the village.  Near him you can find a caged human that starts an escort quest.  Finally there is a rare spawn chieftan that tends to spawn near Ongeku.",

It is allegedly possible to capture more than one raptor at once sometimes if there are others nearby, but this might be a bug. I don't know whether or not this has been fixed.",

    "6968717520871752007/05/22 02:19:45adriangarsideI tried the repetitive dieing approach. It worked even better than above. I bubbled standing on a raised section just diagonally across from the tower with divine shield (10s) and ran into the tower. I didn't see the first crate and ended up running past it up to the 2nd floor. At that point all the mob chasing me had given up. I accidentally aggro'd the ogre that is very near the 2nd crate (I could've avoided that if I'd been thinking faster) but by healing I was able to dispatch him without too much difficulty. Then I opened the crate and immediately ran up to the top floor. I lost all the newly spawned mob by doing that so I could immediately open the 3rd crate. At that point I tried to lose them by dropping all the way down the tower. I'm not sure how many lost but I think I still had several one me at the bottom of the tower. I didn't really try very hard to stay alive but I doubt I would have managed it if I had. So as a ghost I ran back in, found the crate I'd missed (took a bit of looking). Respawned by it, opened it immediately and then immediately ran out of the tower and bubbled as I left. That let me escape all the way to the alliance section with only the final ogre right by that section still aggroing me. Since I had plenty of mana I healed myself and killed him off (without any help from those lazy alliance soldiers I might add - they ignored the hulking great ogre in the middle of their camp!).\
\
So one death and only 2 ogre kills (ignoring the several I killed to get near the tower) to quickly get all the items as a lvl 44 palladin is a resounding success.",

Simply sneak in, locate box, sap ogre, open her up, and vanish to avoid the numerous ogres that pop up.\
\
The first one is the trickiest as there is two ogres that pass by it.\
\
Funny thing is the ogres I made pop up never left as far as I know, so there is 3-5 ogres just sitting around the chests,sucks to be the group trying to do that.",
    "696203650102036502007/12/18 23:20:19Psycovaafter 2.3 what I did as a 39 warrior was grab the first chest and ran as best as i could to the top floor where the 3rd chest is (you can use the pathways to los the mobs a bit and buy more time to go around them and all the way up)  Run back and grab the 3rd chest and immediately jump over the railing behind you and go down and grab the second chest.\
\
Now its all about luck and getting out of there.  Jump all the way down and activate shield wall or put up something to protect you (hunters can use your pets to the best advantage and shamans use your slowing totems) and go the entrance of the tower.  Turn left, and left again immediately and you should see like a cauldren and a fire.  There's a place where the wall meets the tower straight ahead and just wall jump (jump so you get stuck kinda between the wall and the tower) and climb up there.  From there everything just evades and if you run along that wall there's a crack which you can go out of and follow all the way around to the front of Stromgarde.\
\
This is just so you only have to die once and it saves time (not having to run back)",

If you ignore the tower defense pedestal you will only have to fight at most two ogres at the same time as you make your way up the tower and there will be no need to corpse run.\
\
If you want to get to the tower without having to fight the ogres, then look for the high ledge on your left as you pass under the huge archway leading to the ogre infested area. If you jump up on it you can hug the keep wall until you reach the tower without catching any aggro. This ledge will meet with the back side of the tower and form a sharp crease which you can use to get back up on the ledge again and shake any aggro if you decide to make a run out of the tower.\

\
There is a series of quests you have to do, here is the order and locations:\
\
1) Bathran's Hair (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1010) - The guy is located at Maestra's Post, you collect the items from Plant Bundle's which are found to the north of the Post, on the east side of the path.\
\
2) Orendil's Cure (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1020) - Go to Pelturas Whitemoon in the little house by the south bridge in Astranaar.\
\
3) Elune's Tear (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1033) - Head out of Astranaar via the south path and follow the path until you come across a small slit of water on the north side of the path. On the west side of the water slit there is a subtle path on the ground that lead to where the Tear's are. Follow the path up while eliminating all enemies. The tear's are on the small island in the middle of the water body. ( An alternate way to the place is a shortcut path near the graveyard to the South-East or Astranaar.)\
\
4) The Ruins of Stardust (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1034) - Head out of Astranaar from the south. You'll see a smaller path that branches off the main path on the right side. Follow it. Keep heading that direction and you'll soon walk in between two statues, and if you keep going the air will turn a pale yellow-green. There is an island in the water in that area. You collect the quest object off the sparkling plants on that island.\
\
5) Hand in that quest and it'll leave you hear at the quest \"Fallen Sky Lake.\" You've got a decent walk ahead of you for this one. Follow the main path from the south Astranaar exit until you come to a large T crossroad, if you left from Astranaar this T crossroad will come after you cross the bridge over the river, not before where Raynewood retreat is. Head south towards The Barrens, but keep an eye to the West side of the path. There will be a small pond. You have to kill the level 30 Shadethicket Oracle, which is usually on the small island in the pond. Collect the Moonstone and return to claim your reward.\

I hope this helps some of you.",

I had Scrolls of Stam II and Prot II on me and my vw, a Fire protection pot on me, and about +45 shadow damage. Basically, it kills my vw in a few hits then comes after me.

I tried banishing it when I got low on health and mana, then Lifetapping and Bandaging (had already used Healthstone), but with the level disparity, Banish failed every other cast, and broke early.

The drop rate is around 4-5% not very high but they still drop quite frequently, usually takes 2-8 kills for both of them.\

To get the Fine Gold Thread you have to go talk to your Tailor friend in Booty Bay, the one who you gave the Gold Bar to earlier in the quest. He wont have a question mark or exclamation point on his head, but he still has your Fine Gold Thread if you talk to him.",

Gather enough charms, \"tag\" the mob by doing some damage with a spell (it has to be *your* damage, not your pet's!), then simply right-click the charm to kill the exile immediately.  As long as you tagged it, you can loot it.\
\
Getting the initial \"tag\" is the hard part at level 31 as the resist rate is very high.  I found using my VW to tank as long as possible - then saccing him if needed - was a good way to buy me the time needed to get a few points of spell damage on the Exiles' health bars.",

Started this questline again after I learned of the ring a few days ago, and at 19 I had to go back through DM to get the letter, but due to having a high level I just waited at the entrance for him to clear the instance, except for VC, then ran up and looted VC after he killed him, overall (because of the respawning pats) I got about 900 - 1000 exp, so thats not too bad. \

2) Alliance should looking for Weaponsmith trainer [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=11146] Ironus Coldsteel <Special Weapon Crafter>  [/url] to unlearn weaponsmith. \
 Horde should go to [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=11178] Borgosh Corebender <Weaponsmith> [/url]at Orgrimmar. This step costs 10G.\
3)Alliance: Then speak with[url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=11145]Myolor Sunderfury[/url]  (he stands right in the middle of the forge) he will let you choose to become weaponsmith again or turn to armorsmith. This is free and you will keep your skill level after respec.\
(sry I dont know where is the conterpart horde NPC, but should be around the BS trainer)",
    "52837671410767142007/05/02 16:58:38WarondarI held off on deciding to go either Armorsmith or Weaponsmith but completed a multitude of blacksmithing quests leading to these.\
\
Just a rundown on the NPCs involved on the Horde side:\
1. Orokk Omosh - Ogrimmar at blacksmith area\
Learn Barbaric Iron armor patterns, and his 'Omosh Dance' hehe\
2. Aturk the Anvil - Ogrimmar at blacksmith area\
Learn Orcish War Leggings pattern.\
3. Ox <The Mithril Order> Ogrimmar at blacksmith area (starts the whole Mithril Order quests line)\
Sends you to Booty Bay to meet McGavan, and gives you a trinket (requires Blacksmithing skill 210)\
4. McGavan <The Mithril Order> Booty Bay at blacksmith area\
Sends you to meet Galvan the Ancient in Stranglethorn Vale\
5. Galvan the Ancient - <Artisan Blacksmith of the Mithril Order>\
Located in Stranglethorn Vale at 50,20. Teaches 3 Ornate Mithril patterns, and sends you to his pupil Trenton Lightammer in Gadgetzan. Also gives you a better trinket (hope you kept the 1st one) called Signet of Expertise which summons the temporary Hammer of Expertise  (purple item).\
6. Trenton Lighthammer <The Mithril Order> Gadgetzan at blacksmith area\
Teaches you 3 more Ornate Mithril patterns (helm, breastplate, boots).\
Upon completion your are inducted into the Mithril Order which he announces in /yell chat.  You receive the Glimmering Mithril Insignia trinket, which required blacksmithing 225.\
\
So, after all those I think I'm ready to choose Armorsmith or Weaponsmith.  Hope this also helped you to know who to look for.",

    "528317683180176832006/12/21 03:29:11InfinityXHow to become an Armorsmith:\
When you have your Blacksmith skills up to a certain value, \"expert\"  I think, when you talk to the BS trainer in IF choices will pop up that say- tell me more about \"weaponsmith\" or \"armorsmith\".\
\
For Armorsmith you:\
1. Declare Armorsmith\
2. You will be directed to the other Dwarf by the forge about the specifics of being an Armorsmith. He gives you a quest requiring that you make 7 items: 4 ornate mithril helmets, 2 ornate mithril boots, 1 ornate mithril breast plate. But guess what?  This quest is the tip of the iceberg. You don't have the recipes for these items, they are not on the BS training list, and he does not tell you where to go or who to talk to!\
3. You talk to  Hank the Hammer  in Stormwind and complete his quest, which will open up the quest to talk to the guy in BB (by the forge outside) part of the Mithril order.\
4. Talk to guy in BB who then directs you to talk to a Dwarf out in the wilderness of STV. (north of the ogre mound)\
5. Gavan (in the wilderness) will have 3 quests, to get a certain amount of mithril bars, iron bars, citrine, etc. Each quest you complete gives you a recipe.\
6. He will then direct you to his student (by the forge inside) studying in Gadgetzan.\
7. This student will have 3 more quests, that give you more recipes.  After each quest you get more recipes. At this point you are still missing the ornate mithril helmet recipe.\
8. So you go to Gadgetzan, in Tanaris and talk to the Night Elf at the Forge in town. He has 3 quests which get you more recipes. One of those is the ornate mithril helmet.\
9. After all of this you'll have all the recipes you need to complete the original quest: The Art of Armorsmith.\
10. Now it's JUST a matter of working your tail off collecting more raw material to make the 7 items. When all is said and done you get approx 3900 XP for the original quest- The Art of Armorsmith, and a pat on the back, besides having some top notch armor. The the potential to make more.",

\
You might consider making a macro like\
\
/target Mobile Alert System\
/cast Earth Shock(Rank 4)\
\
or whatever rank of whatever instant-cast damage spell you might have. Moonfire, Arcane Shot, Fire Blast, you get the idea. If you're not all about macros, just keep your eyes peeled and make sure your sound is on so you can catch them, otherwise they spawn a pair of elites. Alone, this isn't that bad, but when they come in the middle of a fight already in progress, you're probably going to wipe unless you're slightly overleveled or have a really good and organized group.\
\
A major chokepoint for many Gnomeregan groups is the tunnel with all the Dark Iron Agents. The first pull with 4 Dark Irons is just really tough, make sure you kill mines before they're armed. A little further along, there's a group of 3 Dark Irons and one Arcane Nullifier who seem like they're a linked pull. If you wait for the Arcane Nullifier to path over near you, you can pull it and one of the Dark Irons, splitting it up into two pulls of two instead of another group of 4 that can now reflect spells.  As for Thermaplugg himself, just keep DPSing, have someone run around and push the buttons of the statues with open mouths to prevent being nuked with tons of bombs, and if you have a good mage, Thermaplugg can be kited with Blink and some clever maneuvering.",

\
I have a level 26 Mage and solo'd this quite well.  I do admit that I died twice during this quest, but it was worth it to get the book.  You have to kill or escape the three outside guards, and when you get close to the inside, you will have a rogue gnoll and a shadowcaster to deal with. As soon as you attack the shadowcaster,  you will have one of the demon dogs come after you from above.  I sheeped the gnoll, took care of the demon dog and then battled the shadowcaster and finished him off.  Once I headed up the stairs,  I was met by an `entourage of demon dogs and gnolls,  I kept running up the staircase until they killed me; came back and rez'd in a safe place just right of the top of the stairs (where there is a cove).  If you are careful,  you will not aggro Morganth.  However, before you rez, you might want to scope the book case just to the left and across from the staircase, on the bottom shelf where the book is.  Once I rez'd and mana-up'd, I sheeped the gnoll. As the demon dogs started running for me,  I used frost nova on both of them.  I ran to the bookcase and got the book.  After that,  I didn't care if they killed me. I had the book. As a matter of fact,  I didn't even put up a fight. I let them kill me and took rez sickness at the gy. My repairs were around 14s. \
\
I'm sure you can do this without dying.  But it didn't bother me to do it this way.  \

Pop Mana Shield, run up to the top of the tower, using Cone of Cold and Frost Nova all the while.  Die right on the stairs, then run back to your corpse.  There's a side of the top level that is empty, rez there, buff, mana up, and get ready.  Sheep the gnoll, attack the dogs.  Use Cone of Cold before they get to you, then use Frost Nova if you need to (I was a Frost Mage, so they got stuck on the CoC).  Take them down from there.  The secret to this fight is using everything you've got.  Keep the other guy sheeped, and use Couterspell on the dogs when they use Mana Drain.\
\
I got done with the two dogs just a couple of seconds after the gnoll unsheeped.  I shielded, sheeped the gnoll again, and killed the last dog (remember to use Blizzard here, it works).  After the dogs are down, it's very easy.  Use Evocation while the gnoll is sheeped, and then start off with a Pyro or Fireball then following it up with a Fireblast, and a Counterspell when he starts casting.  Then Frost Nova, and it's over for him.",

\
The first two are easily done. With some thought you won't have any trouble at all.\
\
The third one is the hardest to solo in my opinion. There are a lot of closely packed mobs around it (it's at the soutwest corner of the Zul'Kunda ruins, btw). Approaching from the south I was able to clear a path to the legend with some delicate pulls. Just take your time and don't be afraid to run off if you aggro too many mobs. \
\
#4 can be gotten pretty easily if you know where to sneak. As you go into the Zul'kunda ruins from the east, go up the big hill to the right of the main entrance. Follow that hill north until it gets close enough to let you jump onto (not over) the outer wall. Hop on that wall and follow it all the way north. Then follow the wall west to the upper level of the waterfall. To your left you should see the legend. Pull the mobs closest to it carefull and you'll get it no problem.",

\
At the third tablet there were lvl 33-35 mobs guarding, I used mind control to great success, mind control a caster and let him be beat to death, then taking on 2 melee mobs at a time is not hard. \
\
The fourth tablet is more complicated. I brought a 33 shammy from my guild and we actually wiped once because adds ran up from the lower level. Anyways, the 37 mobs were no prob 2 at a time, just Vampiric Embrace, shield and Facemelt ;)\

You do have to fight to get the fourth tablet, it is guarded by 4-5 mobs.\

Once I cleared out a quadrant of the camp, I sent my Voidwalker in to solo the Baron and then I laid on as much firepower on him as I can.  He is a caster and does not have that much staying power.

\
Undead Ravagers don't pick up on stealthed characters, and they don't hit very hard once you've entered combat. I guess having being eyeless, weaponless, and made of rotting bone makes life hard. Sucks for them, but at 215 xp each, they are probably the best xp/time ratio of any mob at this level that I've seen.\
\
As a rogue I used cheap shot, waited for the stun effect to wear off, then hit them with three sinister strikes all in a row followed by an eviscerate. After all this they usually didn't last long enough for my energy to recharge enough for another sinister strike.\
\
The Necromancers can make things difficult, as they summon undead ravagers to their side. If you've got it, a kick or a quick shield bash makes things much easier, but character classes with area of effect attacks may find it more expedient to just let them summon. ymmv.\

Go over the hills to the right of the entrance to avoid some of the mobs along the way (watch out for the lvl40 necromancer patrolling). The spot your aiming for is 65, 90. It's a hill up on the left as you make your way in. It's quite close to the Goliaths and well away from all the mobs (its also a very handy spot to run to if your dying; stops you getting ganked when you re-spawn). From this spot you should see the Goliaths and a small mound in the middle (possibly with some tin on it). It's anywhere near this mound that you should run and place your ghost magnet on. Run back to the hill and take your pick of the Magram ghosts walking past. By doing it like this you'll have the quest done in no time but always keep an eye out for ravagers re-spawning and that necromancer. Im a lvl 38 druid and gave up on this quest before, if I hadn't found this spot I never could have got it done. Never give up, never surrender!!",

The ghosts with the green aura act as normal though, so if you pull one of them, you will pull all the nearby green aura-ed ghosts.\
\
For every ghost you kill, another will show up, walking towards the magnet.  Use that to your advantage by pulling new ghosts before they get too close to the magnet.  If ghosts aren't showing up or if all the existing ghosts have the green aura, just wait for your magnet to decay.  All the ghosts will disappear and you can place a fresh magnet.",

We entered through the mid level dwarf zone to the north. We did the simple quests the dwarfs give in the center of the zone and then fought in to the map and returned the pick and the map.  I know that someone will tell me that they soloed this on their L12 druid, all I am saying is that the wolves and birds south of the dwarves are much more likely to add than the ones north of the dwarves.  North, if you are the right level you mostly need to worry about the wandering group of four guards.  South you can't run through the zone without aggroing stuff and if you stop to fight, three more mobs will add.\
\
this is a tough zone even if you are level appropriate.  Not sure when I will be able to do this quest. We could get no where near to the NPC and it was late and we were tired. L40s were able to walk around the zone freely, it seemed - or maybe they were just able to kill faster.",

The ears drop off of them as well and you will probably finish the ears before you've gotten friendly with the faction of your choice. Also the mobs won't attack you seeing as how you will be neutral with them.\

\
The basic strategy for a priest is to \"shackle-kite\" him. You want to open with a direct damage spell like mind blast or smite. Or, I suppose if you like, you could also try mind flay. Then once Mor'Ladim starts chasing you, shackle him. Get a little range, wait for some mana to regenerate, then re-open with another direct damage spell. \
\
A few things to note: If you constantly damage and shackle, you will probably run out of mana. So, you really want to wait for mana to regenerate during the shackle. Also, it might take you a little while to wear Mor'Ladim down with this strategy. But ultimately, you will able to solo him. If you have 5 talent points in shadow-weaving, you might be better off using mind blast so that the shadow vulnerability debuff stacks on Mor'Ladim. It's helpful, but not necessary. Also, since you are using shackle, I hope it is obvious that you don't want to do something like, Shadow Word: Pain Mor'Ladim. It will break the shackle for the duration. \
\
There is also a little court yard in Raven Hill Cemetary, which features a broken statue and a cobbled area around it. I found this to be relatively free from all the other monsters roaming the cemetary, and it's a good spot to shackle-kite Mor'Ladim. Just kite him to one side, shackle, and then run to the opposite side.\

Hope this was helpful.",

\
Just pull him with your upper rank frostbolt, kite him with your lowest rank until you get a frostbite proc, then you cast your upper rank frostbolt again, when he gets withing range (often after he activates his 'special') just frost nova, take some distance and repeat the above strategy. When you reach the end of the field, do a quick turn, blink and start kiting him over the field again, the opposite direction.\
\
When you run out of mana, nova him and regen all your mana with evocate, then just continue on with the kiting. I did this without any twinked gear but I did use my Blessing of the Naaru in order to make sure I didn't die when I took two hits, so you might want to take a healing and mana potion doing this.\

This quest chain is not simple if you are doing it at the levels suggested for the quests.  My wife and I did this on our mages as we were leveling up, and the only suggestions I can give for the Stocks is be very careful about runners.  They will run when they are low on health so be ready to have a mage use frost nova or bolt, or some other form of stun.  If the runners escape and get into another room or down the hall from you, they will pull alot more mobs than you might be ready to deal with.  Other than that, this instance is very small and doesn't take too long to do.  \
   The resulting chain from this quest was very interesting in developing the story of the alliance and it's troubles.  I would recommend anyone who is starting out to do this quest, not have your friends do it for you, as the game experience you get from doing the quest (not just leveling xp) and the story is well worth it.  Also not to mention you will continue to develop your skills for working in a group which helps out alot in the later instances.",

\
Once you enter the instance. You fight the inmates that are within the instance. The inmates inside are Elites. \
\
The inmates that the guards outside of the instance fight (the ones that Nippur took a screen shot of) are not part of the instance. They are not Elite NPC's, and they don't even challenge you when they spawn. At least they have not challenged me. \
\
I tried several times to see if Nippur is correct. But he is not. I even killed one that walked past the instance portal, that I could not loot due to distance. When I went outside, he was gone. When I went back inside, he was still on the steps to far for looting.\
\
Just letting you know in case you have any ideas of doing this solo and thinking you can get help from outside the instance.\
\
Although. Running out the exit and then going back inside, resets the inmates. So if you agro a lot of them and make it outside. You don't have to wait to go back in.",

\
You must Speak with Duthorian Rall and he will give you the Tome of Valor. Read the book and he will give you the next quest. The next step is to go to Daphne Stillwell in Westfall. (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=6182)\
\
To get to her you have to go West towards the shore and past Daggerhills. This is the pass in the mountains where you had to kill a bunch of Defias. You have to go up to the exit of the Deadmines and go passed it until you see a house down a slope. Daphne is in the small field in front of the house.\
\
You will have to defend her against waves of Defias. It can be soloed pretty easily, heal Daphne to keep her alive while you dispatch the Defias.\
\
Upon completion, return to Stormwind to the trainer and you will receive your ability to Sense Undead and the shield Bastion of Stormwind (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=9607)\
\
The paladin trainer will then instruct you to go to Jordan Stilwell. He is at the Gates of Ironforge (52,36). He will give you the quest The test of righteousness (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1653)\
\
This quest is putting you on the path of an important Blue two handed Mace that Paladins can use for a long time: Verigan's fist (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=6953#comments)\
\
 A great boost to all Paladins and highly recommended to invest the time to get it.",

Was almost too easy to solo at level 22. No special tactics other than my usual playing style.\

    "16514210910421092007/02/25 12:43:55AhkumTo find her, go to the Deadmines exit and follow the dirt path around back (not inside the cave, around the mountain.)  She will be in the orchard, and will walk to the house before the waves start coming.  The mobs are lvl 16-18 defias who were pretty easy to defeat, even for this undergeared just-turned-20 palladin.\
\
Tips:\
\
* Use Consecration early and often.  It just destroys them, and you get time to recharge your mana after each fight.\
\
* Use Retribution aura, as they hit fast but weak.\
\
* Kill with Daphne - Click on her, then press 'f' to get her target.  The mobs will go down much faster if you two are working together.\
\
* Use a board & sword (or mace, as the case may be.)  That extra defense and mitigation will come in very handy with all of their small strikes.\

\
First, use Retribution Aura. The Defias Raiders don't have a ton of HP, and it will weaken the rest down while you concentrate on one. The first time I tried and failed was with Devotion.\
\
Second, use Consecrate to grab initial aggro on the wave, and use it once or twice more during each fight. Same idea as Ret aura; it will beat all the Raiders down so by the time you get to the last one they will die in 1 or 2 hits.\
\
Third, fight close to Daphne. If you fight close enough to her she will run up and melee with you. Between Ret aura and Consecrate she won't pull aggro, but you could use Righteous Fury just to be safe =)\
\
Finally, bring some Melon Juice. You do get time to drink between waves but your time is limited.\
\
PS - Can't hurt to make sure LoH is up!\
\
Good luck to all =)",
    "1651211474102114742008/01/02 09:00:38AirslashThe quest begins as soon as you talk to daphne. She will run into the house to grab her gun. In the meanwhile you can hear the defias shout as they approach the house.\
\
The first wave is 3 raiders. You should be able to take them down fast by using the retribution aura combined with consecration. I was using a polearm at that time, but it pays of to have a shield equiped.\
\
The second wave consists of 4 raiders. This time you should use the same tactic, by using the retribution aura combined with the consecration on the ground. However, you need to stay really close to daphne to force her to fight with her sword. Assist her by selecting her and presseing the \"f\" button. If you attack the same target as her they go down faster.\
\
The third and last wave consists of 5 raiders. Same tactic as the previous wave. \
\
extras:\
popping bubble will cause the raiders to attack Daphne instead of you. You can use this as a breather to pick them of Daphne one by one in the last fight. If you attack them fast enough they can't kill her.\
\
You can rest between the waves. use this to keep you mana and health up.\
\
The quest fails once you release your spirit. So you can bring a friend along to ress you once you die. (haven't tried it yet)",

This quest is pretty hard and you'll probably not be able to solo it until at least level 26. You get ambushed three times. When I'm leveling a char and try doing this quest as soon as I finish [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=973]The Tower of Althalaxx part 5[/url] I get as far as the last ambush which consists of two spellcaster and one melee satyr. They hit pretty hard, so they'll kill you or the NPC easily[small](unless you're a hunter and thus can use your pet to seperate the 3 mobs on each one of you, then you might stand a chance)[/small].\

    "9761502731101502732007/09/07 10:14:55SihmmThis quest involves escorting Feero Ironhand at normal player running-speed along the road from Maestra's Post in Ashenvale (26,38) to just over the border of Darkshore (43,94).  Feero is ambushed three times by groups of specially-spawning quest mobs, but will also stop along the way to attack any wildlife that wanders into his aggro range.  Following each attack, Feero runs back to the spot he was standing just before the ambush and says a line.  After a few seconds he starts running again - eating, drinking, looting etc for too long will render you unable to catch him up without speed increasing abilities.\
\
Note that, depending on your level and where you are standing on the road, the ambushers may aggro Feero instead of you (or your group).  If they all target him at the start he will die very quickly, so make sure to quickly get the attention of as many mobs as possible if they do aggro him to start with.  The quicker you do it, the fewer mobs you have to \"tank\" as he can quite easily survive the assault of one or two for a short time.  Similarly, if they all target you to start with, Feero will pull aggro from the one he attacks unless you also attack it or cause threat from a damage shield, heal, etc.\
\
[b]First Ambush - Ashenvale, 25,30[/b]\

4x level 21 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=3879]Dark Strand Assassins[/url] spawn.  Regular melee mobs, will attempt to run away at low health (but will not bring adds when they do so, as there are no further adds to bring!).\
Once they are dead, [quote]Feero Ironhand says: Assassins from that cult you found... Let's get moving before someone else finds us out here.[/quote]\

3x level 23 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=3893]Forsaken Scouts[/url] spawn.  One of them seemed to spawn a few seconds after the other two.  Again these have no special abilities, and will attempt to run away at low health.\
Once killed, [quote]Feero Ironhand says: They're coming out of the woodwork today. Let's keep moving or we may find more things that want me dead.[/quote]\

[b]Final Ambush - Darkshore, 43,94[/b]\
[quote]Feero Ironhand says: These three again?\
Balizar the Umbrage says: Not quite so sure of yourself without the Purifier, hm?\
Feero Ironhand says: I'll finish you off for good this time![/quote]\
Meanwhile 3 level 24 named satyrs have spawned and block the path:\
Left (West): [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=3900]Caedakar the Vicious[/url]: fires lightning bolts.  Attempts to run away at low health (but will turn around and start firing lightning bolts again if not killed).  The other two satyrs do not run away (or maybe just died too quickly!).\
Centre, front: [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=3898]Aligar the Tormentor[/url]: warrior-type (uses battle stance!), no other special abilities that I noticed.\
Right (East): [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=3899]Balizar the Umbrage[/url]: fires shadow bolts; has an imp pet which casts firebolts.\
On their death, [quote]Feero Ironhand says: Well done! I should be fine on my own from here. Remember to talk to Delgren when you return to Maestra's Post in Ashenvale.[/quote]\
The quest is \"complete\" at this point.  Feero then runs a little distance up the road and despawns, allowing you to run back to Maestra's Post and hand in the quest.",

\
On my last server, everybody told me to AVOID this quest because it was such a pain in the neck.  And it was.  It took me forever to get the stupid bag.\
\
A few months later I migrated to Gnomeregan and \"started over from scratch\".  I realized this morning that I hadn't done any of the Wetlands quests, and there was nobody from the guild on so I decided to load up on them and try to burn through them as fast as possible.  After visiting the Greenwarden, I was on my way to assassinate some gnolls when I saw a whelp and remembered that a beloved friend of mine in the guild wanted a whelpling pet, so I spent the next four hours farming whelps.\
\
I got the bag OVER THERE.  Like in the 60,40 neighbourhood.  NOWHERE NEAR where the quest says to get it from.  I was farming whelps when one of the larger oozes jumped on me and I killed it outta self defense and the bag dropped.  I just about died laughing.",

On my first couple of characters, this one quest took more time than any of the others in the Wetlands.  However, recently, perhaps in the past year, the drop has come very quickly.  I did it again last night and it dropped on my third kill.  The time before that I believe it was on my tenth.  That's certainly a lot better than the hundred or so it took the first couple of times.  I've heard similar reports from my guildmates, so I suspect Blizzard tweaked the drop rate at some point.",

With my hunter I noted that it seemed to be related to the killing blow, and did some testing on it (turning pet on passive just before the mob died etc) and then reported it to a game master, who suggested it might be a range problem. At that point I abandoned the quest (I'd completed it but not delivered it) and started over, where I tested if range had something to do with it.\

In melee range + killing blow resulted in 'drop'\
In melee range + pet's killing blow resulted in no 'drop'\

Firstly 55,32 is the path up to the cave, go here and head up the path to the cave. \
Secondly once through the cave you do not have to fight all the way down the path and around to the book, just head to the left as you come out of the cave drop down off the side to end up behind the book.\

\
When leveling a marksman spec hunter it's extremely important for your pet to hold aggro from your ranged DPS; if your pet loses aggro, fights can go from 'afkshot for a few seconds, then loot' to 'sacrifice pet just to get away alive' very quickly.\
\
Boars are the only pets in the game at the moment with Charge, which makes the pet rush toward the target, immobilizing it for a quick second. Charge also increases the pet's attack power for the next attack by a lot, and given the way Growl works, the boar will typically charge the enemy, taunt, and instantly have around 1k-1.5k threat - basically, you wouldn't be able in most cases to pull aggro off of your pet from then on before the enemy dies.\
\
Boars can also learn Gore, which is an instant, zero-cooldown focus ability that does damage (also known as a focus dump) that will make talents like Go for the Throat well worth getting. They can also get Bite (a 10-sec cooldown damage ability) and Dash (which shares a cooldown with Charge, so it's not that great). They also have decent health and armor.\
\
Once you've got decent ranged damage, all you really need to watch for is the occasional resist on the first taunt and the mobs around you and your pet.\
\
Bellygrub comes with Charge and Gore automatically, and you won't be able to get another rank of either until around level 50. Learn Bite from a spider in Arathi Highlands around level 32 and you're set for a long time...",

Vancleef isn't too hard if done well. You'll have encountered harder bosses and areas in the instance, such as the large tauren captain who stuns, and the upper deck with Cookie and his friends. Apart from the rogues, he isn't too hard to kill. Just be prepared.\
A mage can polymorph one, a rogue can sap one. Make sure your party is on the deck, as standing below can mean you can't cast as your target is not in view. The tank should attack Vancleef, with DPS backup. Perhaps get one party member to run around, with the 2 bodyguards following, while the other 4 bring down the boss. When VC is dead, it is easy to mop up the others.\
A party of about level 20+ should not find killing this too difficult, provided your party is well-balanced (tank, healer, DPS) and can co-operate well.\
\
Vancleef drops some really good loot, such as the famed Cruel Barb, a green polearm, and other good loot. He also drops a letter, starting a very large quest series which leads onto a reward - The Seal of Wrynn, a ring which will last you until about level 50!\

The item is right out in plain sight, so the explosives are just a fun and easier way to get the item.\
\
The mine is in the eastern portion of Windshear Crag, so work your way there and in front of the entrance, you'll see the wagon of explosives. Before setting the charge, look at the entrance of the mine, and in front of it (just to the right) you'll see a crate with a clickable item -- that's your quest item.\
\
As a hunter, here's how I did this: before setting the charge, I cleared the mobs to my left (along the mountain/hills) almost up to the quest item. Then I set the red charge on the wagon, moved a bit away (towards where I cleared) and then detonated the wagon. The mobs in the center/front will investigate the explosion, leaving a couple of mobs to clear. I sent my pet to both leftover mobs to distract them and looted the quest item, then ran away, calling my pet to retreat, back the way I came. The two mobs that aggroed chased me, and I killed them when I was at a safe distance from the mine.",
    "10801577260157722006/12/15 07:09:32ravenarkBoth quests are easy enough if you know when and where to pull. I did both of them by myself. If you are a druid or rogue, the best thing to do is prowl around the areas so you can get a good idea of where people are, where the plans and letters are, and where to run. \
\
Covert Ops Beta - This is a little more difficult than Alpha. The wagon for this one is on a small hill in front of the mine. The mine is located at about 74,58 or so. There are no guards on this wagon, just an operator, and he's far enough away where he won't aggro. Slightly behind the wagon there is a small hill. You can blow the wagon if you stand on that hill and keep the wagon to your right. \
\
The letters for this one are on the right/east side of the mine entrance, on a tree stump. They look like a stack of books. \
\
Here's the trick for this one...the kobolds don't run when you blow the wagon. So, you need to kill some of them before setting the explosives. On the west side of the mine, there is another small hill with three kobolds wandering. Take them out. On the east side of the mine, along the ridge, there are two other kobolds. Take them out too. There is another kobold closer to the letters, but if you attack him you'll draw the attention of everyone else, so leave him alone. \
\
Run over to the wagon (don't let anyone see you!) and set the explosives. Get over to the hill and set them off, then take off running. Head over the hill where you killed the first kobolds, then turn to the mine and get the plans. Then run AWAY from the mine (I went to the east, along the cliffs). The kobold you didn't kill will most likely aggro, but if you stop to kill him the rest of the Venture guys will be back and aggro. Just make sure your health is full and run along the cliffs. He stops giving chase soon.",

Instead of sapping Morbent, I opted for Ambushing his strongest guard (with a 3/3 in Imp. Ambush, he was down nearly half his health at the first strike). I killed each guard in turn, ignoring Morbent completely - which, yes, meant eating shadowbolts, so I did get pretty low on health by the end - and Vanished as soon as the last one was dead. This left Morbent alone, with me in Stealth mode right behind him.\
\
The 'Morbent's Bane' item has a 30-second cooldown when you first equip it, so no bandages are necessary; by the time the cooldown was complete, I was back to full health. Using the Bane aggros Morbent, so there was no chance to open with a sneak attack; fortunately, you don't really need one (just make sure to swap the Bane out for a real weapon right after you use it!). Without his guards, Morbent is easy meat: his physical attack is weak, and (as FirefoxUzi notes) his spells can be easily interrupted with Kick or Gouge. I threw Mind-Numbing poison on the slower of my blades, just to make his life extra-miserable... ;)",

From this vantage point, the soul to be freed is straight in front of you, on the pyramid shaped altar thing the Chalice of Elune for this quest: http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=9519 is right in front of you and two lumps of fel wood for: http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=9517 are just to your left and right also. They respawn almost immediately so you don't have to go searching round the whole place to get the 5 you need.\

\
Though linked to each other, Otto and Falconcrest are not connected to their guards.  I cleared out the mobs in the room in front of their stage, but didn't bother with the two guards up by them.  Then I took advantage of Falconcrest's higher level -- and thus larger aggro radius -- to proximity pull them to me.  I just edged up to the platform, and when Falconcrest (and thus Otto) aggroed, I retreated back into  the area I'd just cleared.  Their guards stayed put.\
\
Otto does less damage than Falconcrest, but because of his frequent interrupts, I killed him first.  When he gets low on health, he runs, but even when he ran through one of his guards, [i]they did not come to his aid[/i].  So I just let him go, turned on his boss, and then finished him when he came back.  Falconcrest doesn't really have any special tricks, but since he does hit very hard, taking him out was a very close thing.  If you have any way to mitigate his damage, it will help.  I went in with a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=4421]Scroll of Protection III[/url], [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=3826]Mighty Troll's Blood Potion[/url], and an [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=9206]Elixir of Giants[/url].

http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1947 (Obtained at your Trainer at level 30)\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1948\
http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1949 (3-Quest Chain)\
\
Brought the quest's back completed, she said some stuff then bam I got the wand quest. She did some more stuff then I turned in the quest for a badass wand at level 30.\
\
The moral of this story is, YOU CAN GET THIS WAND AT LEVEL 30.",

    "195212638241866712007/07/25 05:41:18CalminaionNope - Firstly, when you hit 30 - your mage trainer (in whatever city) will tell you to come and talk to Tabetha.\
\
Next, she gives you 2 quests, Items of Power (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1948) and Hidden Secrets (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1949), follow these through (involves an SM library run) and return to Tabetha.. she'll then give you this quest !!\
\
Hope that helps",
    "1952763224076322006/12/06 16:26:11bangyThis quest gives 3 great wands for its level, and they will serve you well for quite a few levels. They either boost your +fire, +frost or +arcane damage.\
\
The quest is not hard to do, but finding the quest giver can be quite difficult, who is located in the middle of Dustwallow Marsh, a level 45 zone. If you keep frostnovaing, popping up mana shield, blinking etc, however, you should be fine.\
\
The quest series start at your mage  trainer at level 30, so go speak to him/her. Don't miss this quest, I see lots of mages at level 40 who use worse wands because of this.",
    "1952125341401253412007/07/23 05:38:48DarkfireIt's not about the DPS its about the +Damage and stats. They're almost all equal and it depends on what talent spec you are. If your Fire obviously pick Ragefire wand, if your Frost then obviously pick Icefury wand and if your Arcane then pick Nether Force Wand. Not like you ever use your wand more than your spells so why pick DPS go for the stats and thats the most important thing about these wands. If your hybrid then choose the wand your most comfortable with.\
Good luck and happy hunting mages!!",

    "1699165481201654812007/10/10 06:07:36bluewireI found some great tips somewhere else that helped a lot.\
\
The coords 20,27 are perfect.\
\
At level 21 (Warrior) I took the advice to scout the route, and clear a few mobs before taking the quest.  Go up the hill towards Bellygrub's garden, and then in the middle of the garden, turn right and climb the hill.\
\
I found 2 mobs on the plateau there, spread apart enough to kill one at a time.\
\
Going north, sticking to the left, I was able to avoid the small camp, and find the path heading up and left, between the rocks, just north of the tree.  This goes around the tent camp, and to the ravine leading to the cave.\
\
I found one mob in the ravine, and took him out.  I took out two at the cave door.\
\
Then ran back, mob free, got drunk, turned around and ran back to the cave.  I had to kill one mob on the plateau, and one just inside the cave, before going far enough inside to ding the quest, and then run home clean.  \
\
Just under 5 minutes - and only that long because the booze really is disorienting, and I took it slow to be sure I stuck to the right route.  There certainly was enough time in the hour available to clear the whole path, and also to wait for the booze debuff to wear off, but hey ... someone thought we should do it drunk, so that's how I wanted to try it.\
\
Excellent fun quest.",

I tried to run through all of them, because they seemed much lower than me, but then i died and ressed up and saw like 5 level difference. other thing is the distance you see, it's bigger than it is anyway.",

Once you get the quest head right out of the pub, past a couple of houses, then turn right to go up a hill. Once at the top of the hill keep to the left of the camp and you should be fine. You might have to take on one or two of the gnolls, but they're not to hard.",

I started at the cannon on the left facing the bay and started running as soon as the cog appeared.

There is one spot (I forget where, sorry) where the beam dips down and you can run over it.\

You need to hit about 10-11 mortar hits on him, but all mortars hit and have no casting time so can be used on the run. As long as you keep running you'll be fine.",

\
The knockback actually is a bit farther than 10-15 yrds; It's more like 30. If you're lucky, you'll hit something in the way, and not go too far.\
\
The marksmen can also be healed, which made it extremely easy as a Priest. I just ran to a canon, fired it, and tossed a renew at every marksman as I passed them. Only lost 1 by the end of it (mainly because I never stopped to heal them, only used renews).",

\
Gorgannon - 89,76. Follow the first ramp directly to him.\
\
Now here's where I got stumped...\
\
Diathorus - Come back down the ramp you just went up to fight gorg... go the other way and look for the small glowing stones  that senstarr mentioned, follow that to the top.\
\
At the top and a few paces forward you'll see a bonfire and an entrance to a maze cave. \
\
He's inside a maze cave filled with the demons you've been fighting since the first part of this quest. I submitted screenshots of the path you should take once inside this cave, but they're not posted yet so I will take the liberty of converting it to text.\
\
 - Go down the initial walk way till you get to the first intersection. \
\
 - At the first intersection bare left (not down a hallway!) down a ramp that spirals underground, follow that till the next intersection.\
\
 - At that intersection you will see a bridge straight ahead of you before you can see anything else, that is your yellow brick road to Diathorus.\

Do try and kill the packs of hounds first, they're easy (I was lvl 30/31) and they can be a pain when they walk by you and you're in the middle of a fight. Shamans, drop a magma totem and a health totem, and use earth shock as much as you can and you'll be fine.",

Fortunately, not-so-bright players tend to farm these elementals for their drops (I say not-so-bright because it's almost always better to farm something else)( Moderator - Xp is good there, hence people farm em.). Warriors also have a quest to take out elementals, so if you do this at your server's peak time, there is a good chance you can just walk up to each stone and get the appropriate key.\

\
You're much better off switching to a weapon that's close to the same value in intellect, but with spirit instead of plus damage, as well as the +20 spirit enchant, then popping your Evocation with a much higher regen rate than normal. Switching weapons back you're closer to full mana, you didn't have to wait 30 seconds to do so, and you weren't casting damage anyways because you were using Evocation.\

Since the Mobs are magical, definitely use the recommended buffs as stated, and use Blizzard if you are specced in frost and flame strike if fire specced (obvious I know, but you never know with some people) \
No need to frost nova them in place first before starting Blizzard or FlameStrike, they will move only a little bit but not enough to move out of the AoE radius\
Again, Great tip for some insane XP",

\
I'm having trouble with the 5-groups.  The ones of 4 and below I can kill (admittedly usually have 100 life or less at the end).  Most of my gear is +frost damage stuff.",

I used mage armor, arcane int and 1 mana pot. I pulled all on once... when she opened the crack all twelve or more aggroed me. so i had no chance but to do this.",
    "19575175810517582007/03/15 18:09:08PhatrikThis quest is really easy when being a frost-mage and the use of nature protection potions. My alt mage is alchemist, so I made a couple of nature-pots since each one of the Mana Surges cast lightning-bolt.\
Wait until 6 mobs had spawned, pop a nature-potion (+ dampen magic & manashield in case the naturepot runs out), and use Blizzard until the mobs are dead. Wait for cooldown of another nature-pot and use it, then repeat this with the rest of the mobs. Childsplay.",
    "19574860930486092007/03/09 07:57:14ReaonIf you're not 40, don't bother trying to do this trick, it's near impossible below 40. Anyway, I tried doing the trick at 40 both fire and frost specced and I have to say, frost is way better than fire in this case. Why? Mainly because Ice Barrier is a lifesaver. Though Blast Wave does some nice damage, it's mainly protection you need for this trick (imo) so Ice Barrier is best.\
\
+dmg gear is better than +int gear here, but +sta is also very usefull. I've got +83dmg atm and my cone of cold crits for 650, which takes away roughly 60/70% of their life.\
\
The best way to do these guys is the way topsub described (flamestrike > immediately blink > frost nova > cone of cold > arcane explosion til dead)\
\
Speed is also very important during these fights, if you slack you WILL die (unless you're lvl 42+ maybe). These guys can use instant shocks and from what I see, it doesnt seem to be on cooldown, cause one time I actually got hit by 2 shocks in a row from one mob (the rest was dead, so I'm sure it was just one mob).\
\
Also, should you be AoE'ing and a new mob spawns while you're killing them, it would be wise to AoE the rest and then run. The best way to run is southwest across the water, since there are practically no mobs there. Just a little hint.\
\
At lvl 40 they give 245 exp each, so 490 rested. If you aoe 1 group of 5 mobs while rested, that's nearly 2500 exp... need I say more? This trick is the best ever, I levelled from 40 to 43 in one day without being rested.\
\
ps. these mobs use either lightning shock, lightning bolt or melee, so there's no point in using wards. Just get a friendly priest to buff you and you'll be fine.",

For AoE, Fire or Ice, I'd Flamestrike first regardless. (Instant Dmg + the AoE DoT) Then run in and CoC/AE. That's me though. If your frost you may want to nova first if you have the talents for higher dmg against frozen targets, then CoC, then AE.\

For Single pulling, the mobs don't link. Hit a mob, CS it, then destroy it.",

Always hear about Mage AoEing is the best thing since sliced bread? Never been able to REALLY do it? Now you can! Go to the Dustwallow Marsh to receive this quest, Mana Surges, but be aware you would have to complete the quest to go to Uldaman before you can gain access to Mana Surges. This is a really nifty trick that I have never heard anybody talk about. I just happened to find this out on my own and startd to use it on my mage. With this nifty trick you can gain up to 55,000 xp/hr at level 40-45 easily, and yes, solo. Here's what you do:\
\
1.) Make hundreds of food/drinks.\
\
2.) Accept Mana Surges quest.\
\
3.) Walk outside near the two torches and buff up. (Mage Armor, Dampen Magic, Arcane Intellect, Mana Shield)\
\
3.) DELETE THE QUEST! (This is the most important part.)\
\
4.) The mobs spawn, 2 sets of 2's, 2 sets of 3's, 2 sets of 4's, all the way up to 2 sets of 5's. The mobs will spawn 1-5 seconds after they die. So AS SOON as the mobs die, run away and start resting up for the next set of AoEs.\
\
5.) Your able to AoE these mobs and get as much XP as you possible can, for 10 minutes, then the mobs despawn. After this, go back to step number 2.\
\
Repeat all of the above steps to get some of the best xp in the game.",

\
You should NOT try this trick before lvl 40 without a healer is my advice.",

    "195720959911258142007/12/29 22:34:35RarehunterNew tip! I figured that any ranged dps class can do this between the levels of 38 and 45, as long as they keep it up quickly. A mage is required to START the quest and get the Mana Surges to spawn, but after, the mage can leave while you (any ranged dps class like druids, priests, warlocks) can stay and kill the Mana Surges. As long as they keep dying, the rift that they spawn from will not despawn. Just remember to bring lots of water and some food!\

\
One note:\
\
I am a frost mage with all +damage gear so my life is kinda low. What i found works best for me was this:\
\
1. Once full of life and mana cast \"Ice barrier\"\
2. Stand middle of the torches and cast a \"flamestrike\"\
3. after cast instantly \"blink\" into them \
4. cast \"frost nova\"\
5. followed by instant \"Coc\"\
6. then AE till dead but at this point  should be just few AE away from death.\
\
Then repeat.\
\
For me after the big 5 groups i had anywere from 200 - 350 life left  but they are dead.\
\

Works on all packs including 5 pulls.\
#1: From behind the house, cast Flamestrike\
#2: Run into them, CoC\
#3: Stay there, wait for GCD and FN\
#4: Quickly run behind the corner of the house, just out of LoS\
#5: Recast Ice Barrier, strafe, and Blizzard\
#6: Once Ice Barrier goes down, run back to the corner of the house, and wait for them to path towards\
#7: CoC and AE (should be 1 of each) to drop them\
\
Notes:\
#1: If done right, this will retain about 500 life, and about 1000 mana, setting up for the next 5 pull nicely\
#2: I have very very little spell damage",

You may have to zone out the first few times because he hits relatively hard. At his smallest point he averages 15 damage (To a 48 Mage). Wanding him down until he summons the shardling will conserve enough of your mana for the entire fight. To take care of the Shardlings simply frost nova then Arcane blast two or three times. Switch back to your wand until the next shard appears, rinse, repeat, and you shouldn't have much trouble. The spells he seems to reflect the most are any bolt spell, I never once had any damage reflected from the Arcane Blasts.",
    "19568144920814492007/05/11 14:46:08tyzehrDid this as a 39 fire mage. I firstly made him grow smaller, reducing his damage by using AoE spells and wanding, then when he summons a shardling, run out of the instance, back in, wait for the shardling to despawn, and repeat. When he's at his smallest (detect magic, he should have 4 debuffs), wand him with mana shield active and when he summons an add, simply frost nova, use aoe spells (Flamestrike in my case, AE, CoC, Blast Wave) and repeat wanding him with mana shield, and use some mana pots/jades and/or evocation if you really need to. Just takes some patience",
    "1956163413301634132007/10/05 16:57:22HearthvaderJust completed this today as a moderately geared 36 frost mage. With him being six levels higher than me it was very difficult to hit him even with Elemental Precision (Resist chance -3%) The boss will splinter off and create adds every 20% damage he takes, when he does this his melee damage drops dramatically though. Each splinter seems to drop his damage by about 20% or so down to around 10-40 or so once fully debuffed. The first splinter was the most difficult to pull off as he starts off the fight hitting like a freight train hitting a stalled bus full of orphans, nuns and puppies (about 300-400 on cloth... ouch.)\
\
Like everyone else has said, start off the fight at max range, put up the mana shield and frost / fire ward then nuke him as hard as possible before he can get to you. (May need to run out if first fire/ice-bolt is resisted or reflected.) Once he's down to 80% he'll shard and spawn the add... I had to run out at this point as it took everything I had to just drop him 20% the first time. Then with each set of adds I would blizzard at max range then frost nova, cone of cold, arcane explosion them down and run for the exit again.\
\
This got much easier as the splinter debuffs stacked and even reduced the numbers of attempts taken to splinter him again. Once he was fully debuffed I got to start the long part of wanding him to death. This was remakably easy to do, even at 36, by just keeping mana shield up and wanding him down. He will still spawn his adds every 20%, but they are easy to deal with by just frost novaing, then CoC & Arcane Explosion til dead. I had Gift of the Naaru to heal myself, and for a mage it's pretty much a full heal every 3 minutes, and evocated twice to keep my mana up. \
\
All in all this process took me about an hour. Probably woulda been smarter to get somebody to help me, but this way does work too.",

    "19568721511814492007/05/22 04:13:31DanWHNice work, however, one point to make it a little faster. Don't wait for each add to despawn after exit. Just Pyro, fireball and fireblast then CoC (about 25%), then exit as a new shard spawns. If any spells reflect, just exit and start again. Then, as said, tank the little guy after all the orignal adds have despawnd using FN to root the new spawns, take them out with AE/BW and CoC.\

AOE down the shard, then focus dps on the sentinel. Soloing this is a royal bitch, i kid you not. At level 38 I'm still figuring out how to deal with him.

The drop rate is about 55%, I got it on my second kill because I am an unlucky person. Also, after you get this quest, she tells you to talk to her Acolytes behind her.

\
If you go the route of the Felhound you get to choose from a Shadow damage staff, or a Shadow damage Orb. Otherwise, the route of the Infernal gives you a Fire damage Staff, or a Fire damage Orb.\
\
But first, you need to cleanse the orb, and you don't want to turn anything in before hand because you will fail the quest forever (unless they fixed that finally). To do that you have to head to Dustwallow Marsh to find Tabetha (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=6546), ** Remember her location, she is used for future quests**. Tabetha will have you fight a level 40 Elite Felguard, which is possible at level 36 if you constantly fear it while putting Damage over Time spells on him, and have your Void Walker out.",

\
You will need to choose between Infernal and Felhound, this will determine your reward. Infernal is +Fire Dmg and Hound is +Shadow Dmg.\
\
Once you have decided, head to Mannoroc Coven (1.) and slay Burning Blade Summoners for the Infernal orb. Once done find either the Mana Eater or Infernal and use the item to Capture the soul just like Soulshards. Now head to Dustwollow Marsh (2.) and Speak with Tabetha. You will now have a TIMED quest to cleanse the stone eby killing the demon residing inside. It is Lv40 Elite but very low Def and Resistance.

\
The quest invovles assasinating the boss of the traitors against Stormwind. As a rogue, mage,  warlock, hunter , this quest is easier because you can crowd control one (sap, sheep, pet, fear, etc). However, as a warrior you may find difficulties.\
\
A useful tip is to wave at the guards when they walk away. Because they are friendly, they wave back to you (they are the only guards who do) and stop walking. Keep waving until the speech is over and recorded. Then charge in, and do a decent amount of damage, Just before you die, pop a hp pot and run to the guards you were waving to. Because they waved back, they will not have gone far and will help you kill the 2 traitors.\
\
Make sure you get a decent amount of damage first though, or else you won't get the kill. You need to take at least 1/4 chunk of their hp bar before you can get a kill.\
\
keep /waving for all you're worth! Do this and you can complete the quest at around level 30. The key is taking the kill.",

Enter the Uldaman caves as though you are heading toward the instance. Keep following the path, you should run off a small ledge and through a tunnel. Continue following the path until you get to a much higher ledge overlooking the instance entrance. Don't jump off the ledge! Ignore the instance entrance, keep following the path round to the left, almost immediately you will come to a kind of fork, keep to the left. You will shortly come across an entrance on your right to a room full of troggs, ignore this room, stay left, keep going. Next on your right you should see a big corded off room that is set slightly lower than the path and is full of dwarves, this is the room! (if you accidentally miss this and go too far don't worry you will get to a dead end almost straight away) The room is full of various Elites who will aggro each other easily, so if you plan to solo this then plan to fight 2-4 Elites at once :) The tablet is inside that big chest (ark-like thing) in the middle of the room.\

If you do want to try this quest at a lower level here's the steps that worked for me.\
\
1. Use Voidwalker\
2. As soon as the Felguard is summoned, have the VW tank for a pretty good period of time.  DoT the Felguard.  When the DoT's finally overpower the VW's ability to tank (he can't hold aggro) then fear the Felguard and tell the VW to stay (so you don't pull more enemies.  The Felguard won't pull enemies when he's feared).\
3. Use the VW's Sacrifice when you are getting low on life or need a break from getting hit.\
4. Keep using a combination of Fear + DoT's, Drain Life and the occasional Shadowbolt or Searing Pain whenever you can.\
\
I used one healthstone and two potions in this fight (two health).\
Also, I am affliction spec.  The Shadow Trance helps a lot as long as you keep Corruption and Drain Life on the Felguard.",

It may take a tad longer, but totally worth it in the end (because you won't be dying constantly).",

\
I had no problem at all farming for it as a 22 hunter (I got here a bit late), but it was utterly boring. A few notes on my last 30 minutes of gaming.\
\
First of all, the \"ruins\" where you'll find the Dark Strand mobs are located right around 32, 31...just head northeast from Maestra's Post and you'll run right into them. There are four mobs that drop the quest item: Dark Strand Cultists (with imp pets), Dark Strand Adepts (with VW pets), Dark Strand Excavators, and Dark Strand Enforcers. Despite what other posters may have noted, the drop rate of the quest item is the same for all of the mobs: 4 percent. As I noted earlier, it took me around 30 minutes to drop...just long enough for me to start considering going elsewhere.\
\
While I managed to garner a tiny little bit of coin, some wool cloth, and a green or two, I'm still not entirely sure the effort put into this quest was worth the reward.\
\
If you have other quests to do, don't really need to grind for experience, or simply don't like to grind then this quest isn't for you. If you need the experience, enjoy grinding, and have 30 minutes to a couple of hours to blow, get to it. :-)",

Start with a shield, DD spell, dot, dot, and wand. When the shield comes down, stop, shield, renew, dot, wand, ignoring the pet. When the master died, shield, dot, heal, wand.  I finally managed to clean the warlock free area at 31,31 and then got the next several pops - and then one popped while I was killing another and I died - could not keep a shield up. \
\
Lather, rinse, repeat. Died about 4 rimes. Finally approached it from the other direction to no real difference except that I was working in to the excavators and enforcers on my left, not my right, and the void walkers seemed popular (but they have a low aggro radius as compared to the other mobs) and as I was clearing the 31,31 camp from the edge of the field that I'd already cleared, I killed an enforcer and looted and there was the orb.  I finished clearing the excavators just for experience, but then I split - first time I left the camp without dying.\

\
I did the talking to Sunderfury first thing and then picked my spec.  I went with special weapons crafter.  I did the quest, \"The Way Of The Weaponsmith\" and I turned it in.  After that, I have been unable to train for special weapons or armor crafting.  I have plenty of gold for the training, the required levels for blacksmithing and experience.  Both trainers have new crafting to teach me, as they are lit up.  But the \"Train\" button stays grey and nothing happens when I clicked on it, naturally.  I even paid the 5G to relearn my spec and all that did was leave me 5 less gold in my pocket.\

Has anyone else had this happen and what do I do to progress in my blacksmithing?  Thanks for any help you might be able to offer, in advance.",

\
1) Go to the Great Forge in Ironforge and speak with the armorsmithing trainer and ask him to unlearn armorsmithing. This cost me 100 gold.\
\
2) Speak with Myolor Sunderfury nearby, he will present you with two options one of which is to become a weaponsmith.\
\
3) To specialize (swordsmith, hammersmith, or axesmith) you need to go to Everlook, in Winterspring. Once there enter the building with the large telescope and inside are three NPCs. \
\
Lilith the Lithe teaches you how to become a hammersmith.\
\
Kilram teaches you how to become an axesmith.\
\
Seril Scourgebane teaches you how to become a swordsmith.\
\
Speak with the one you want to and ask them to make you a specialist like them; now you have officially specialized. This means that you can go learn all of the weaponsmithing plans and specialized trainable plans that you have the skill for. To learn the high end weapons in the Burning Crusade go to Shattrath and learn them from the trainer at the forge.",

Another useful remark may be that Harpys and Ambushers are mainly found in the north end of the valley while Slayers and Roguefeathers are found more to the south.

\
Located him at the very peak of the mountain, about where you'll see a green dot/pool on the map. Or if you're using a coord mod, 48,19 as onegirlarmy pointed out.\
\
As Childermass stated before - this guys runs around *alot* ... and if you can't trap him or slow him down, he's bound to run into alot of the other mobs. It's a good idea to clear the top of the platform of Acolytes/etc where he is first, and than the ones right below him (or vise versa).\
\
Another thing, he summons water minions. They're only level one, but he can summon up to 3-4 of them. Also, I may be wrong about this, but I *think* if you don't kill them quick enough - they heal him. Couldn't scroll up far enough in the combat log after to check this.\
\
Was able to do this using a Voidwalker as the tank. Just have him chase him around. Dot up Sarilus as much as possible in the beginning (Curses, Corruption, Immolate, etc...). Have to wand the Water Elementals and cast shadowbolts, searing pain, etc... whenever you can. \
It requires alot of multitasking (but as a lock you should be use to that by now), but it is possible - at 9% HP, I just shadowbolted him down.\

The problem can be seen in your quest log. After accepting the quest (and Belnistrasz BOOKS it so fast you barely have time to chase after him), check your quest log. Mine said \"Protect Belnistrasz while he performs the ritual to shut down the idol\" TWICE in the quest log.\
\
If you see this message TWICE in the quest log, that means there is going to be a MASSIVE spawn of DOUBLE mobs. Even with this quest being green to me, I still wiped. Just sit there if you die and don't release - the mobs don't attack Belnistrasz at all and you will get a (Completed) even while you're dead.\
\
Release, make the long corpse run back, and re-clear all the way back to the wipe location. You can then clear out the mobs single pull at a time and complete the quest by clicking the brazier.\
\
Best of luck! Hope the quest doesn't bug out for you like it did for me!",
    "352514665170146652006/12/13 06:09:48kreghxhave done this myself, so I can say with 100% confidence that this quest CAN be done by all of the people in your party at once. \
\
The setup for this quest is just plain dumb, and desperately needs to be reworked. Basically the way this quest works is you have to talk to Belnistrasz a couple of times (at least twice), and he eventually will offer you the quest Extinguishing the Idol, when you accept this final quest from him, the escort process begins. At this point, everyone in your party that talked to Belnistrasz up until the point where he was offering them the chance to accept the Extinguishing the Idol quest (but have not actually accepted the quest) will be given the typical \"X has started an escort quest would you like to join? Yes or No\" option. Anyone who has not, will not get credit for the quest. \
\
What typically happens when playing through RFD is that someone in your party will click through all of the dialogue boxes with Belnistraz before anyone else has had a chance to talk with him, the quest will begin, and they will be the only one to earn credit for it. If this happens, just let that party member go and try to complete it on their own. That sounds completely fair to me. \
\
Make sure that before you get to this part of the dungeon you warn your party about what is going to happen in regards to accepting this quest. Then have each member talk to Belnistrasz, and ask them \"Does it say Extinguishing the Idol\" at the top of the quest description. If the answer is no, then tell them to select \"accept\" or \"continue\". If the answer is yes, then tell them to hit \"decline\" and wait for everyone else to go through this process. Once everyone in your party can talk to Belnistrasz and have \"Extinguishing the Idol\" pop up, accept the quest.",

\
I was on the Magical Analysis task (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=602) when I logged in.\
I had gotten the book Legends of the Gurubashi, Volume 3 (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=3899) with the Library Scrip (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=3898#comments), the book was in my bank.\
I picked up some water breathing potion knowing I would be trying this.\
I finished Magical Analysis.\
Got the quest Ansirem's Key (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=603).\
Flew to Booty Bay, tuned in Ansirem's Key quest.\
Got \"Pretty Boy\" Duncan quest (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=610).\
Did the \"Pretty Boy\" Duncan quest, turned it in.\
Got The Curse of the Tides.\
Went out there, drank a water breathing potion and cleared out all the murlocks near the altar.\
I then opened my inventory, right clicked on Catelyn's Blade, then clicked on the altar.\
I saw in the chat:\
Short Jon Mithril yells: Ah, hits the spot!\
Gazeban says: Oh now you've gone and angered me! Time to see the true force of the Stone of Tides!\
\
Gazeban showed up, I killed him and got the Stone of the Tides.\
\
Don't know if it will work for you, but it did for me.  Maybe it was because I didn't log out between certain stages, perhaps because I right-clicked on the blade, then the alter, no clue, but I hope it helps.\
Also while you're in the vicinity it's might be worth picking up 9 Blue Pearls for the Badlands quest Pearl Diving (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=705).\

\
Swim down to the glowing blue altar and approach from east side. There are only 2 murlocks there instead of 3 - 4 on the west side. From a distance, shift to druid/natural form and hit one with Entangling Roots, follow with the rest of your spells to get him down to about 2/3 health before he comes at you. Melee with your best weapon. Cast Regrowth to stay alive. Shift back to Sea Lion form to breathe (you can still attack in this form). Once breath bar is gone, shift to druid form and you'll probably have to cast Regrowth again. Smack him a few more times and he's dead.\
\
Give it a few seconds to get your health/mana back and get the other murlock. Try to do this close to the east side of the altar. The other murlocks didn't aggro me from there. Right click Catelyn's Blade, destroy the altar and get ready for melee with Grezban (or whatever his name is). He spawns instantly. If you have enough health/mana left, he'll be pretty easy to take down as he's a 40 but not elite. Watch your breath and shift into sea lion form when needed so you don't drown.\

One thing to try is clicking on the dagger in your inventory first, then on the altar.  When I tried that, I got an immediate error message the first time, then the second time it worked.  Obviously, your mileage may vary.\

i had to even make a GM ticket about this and their reply was (by mail off course) :\
\"bla bla ... abandon the quest and retake it .. bla bla\"\
\
i did it with a friend who had it to, at a first try he touched the altar the Guzban poped up, easy kill loot and your done\

btw since 2.3 the mobs around the altar are not elite so it's not so difficult to solo it\

i hope this will help other people who might get stacked to, until Blizz get this thing fixed anyway",

Okay, so you've got your 3 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=3575]Iron Bars[/url], 2 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=2841]Bronze Bars[/url], 1 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=3577]Gold Bar[/url], 4 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=4234]Heavy Leathers[/url], 1 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=2319]Medium Leather[/url], and 1 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=2592]Wool Cloth[/url].  Give all this stuff to an Engineer you can trust who has a skill level of at least 185.  You might want to look for a gnomish engineer since they have to make a couple of these to complete their specialization.  That way you'll be reasonably sure they've learned all the relevant plans and have at least a vague recollection of how to construct one.  You might even look for a twink, since they tend to be pretty serious about Engineering.  However, any Engineer with at least 185 in skill has the potential to make one since these are all trainer recipes.  \
\
With these ingredients, the engineer will first turn the Gold Bar into three [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=10558]Gold Power Cores[/url].  Only one of those cores is needed, but don't sweat the extras.  Let your pet engineer make a few silvers off them.  It's the least you can do.  \
\
He'll then combine the power core he's just made with one of the Iron Bars to make a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=4389]Geochronatom[/url].  He'll take the other two Iron Bars and turn them into an  [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=4387]Iron Strut[/url].  Finally, he'll take the two Bronze Bars, the Medium Leather, and the wool cloth and turn them into a [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=4382]Bronze Framework[/url].  \
\
With all of his ingredients at hand, he'll take the four Heavy Leathers and combine them with the Geochronatom, Iron Strut, and Bronze Framework to make, ta da, an [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?item=4392]Advanced Target Dummy[/url].  \
\
He'll give you the dummy, you'll take it to Warug, and he'll break it.",

\
Completed it after reading the above, but without dying. Run in and veer slightly to the left, run up the slope and onto the steps behind Balos, and the mobs start evading. From these wooden steps I was able to step off them and burst Balos down before stepping back on them to make the others to evade again. Once Balos turned friendly I could complete the quest from the steps and accept the next part before running out.\
\
Note for shammies: I managed to use ghostwolf while stood on the wooden steps so ran out in that form, never though to use it on the way in though as I figured it would be 'indoors' anyway.\

Worked a charm; mobs died much faster so I didn't take too much damage anyway. Succy tended to initially draw their attention when she opened, so I put her on defensive, so even when she did she was right next to the totem (as that's where I was standing).\

Even with the skill to mine the stuff, at level 35 the Kobolds still posed quite a problem for me.\
\
They begin to \"run away in fear\" with a little higher health than most MOBs and they are pretty close together. I commonly had to deal with three or four separate battles before a rest as they kept adding right when they were about to die. If that wasn't enough, they have Frost Mages too. So you have to deal with the Chill effect on top of everything else.\
\
Lastly, and probibly worst of all for alliance characters, like myself, is the cave is right next to the major Horde Town in Arathi. I got ganked three times in mid combat by a rogue.\

\
it doesn't feel right that as a paladin, you have to go out and get the supplies to give to someone so you can get a cool hammer. When you could do this quest and get a cool sword while doing a good deed (though to start off the paladin quest, you save someone's life and farm. But still)\
\
The weapons you get from both arn't too far off damage wise, and this has a cool proc (which as a SoC paladin, I like more than stats). The Hammer has 4 more max damage (same min) and is .1 faster than archeus, and it has 6 stam and some intelect (7?).\
\
I don't know the level on the hammer, but I know the level on archeus is 35, meening you can enchant it with the new enchants that can be gotten from BC.\

Meh, I guess it's just an opinion thing, but I think this quest is better as a paladin quest then the lvl 22 paladin quest, and the weapon is a better paladin weapon than the paladin weapon (and it's good in the hands of a warrior too XD)",

Upon first approaching Piznik you'll have to kill 5-6 mobs (watch out, they tend to stack on each other, so what first looked like four mobs to me was actually six) just to get the quest.  Also as a previous poster mentioned, Piznik has very low health - he can be killed by a single mob, and rather quickly if you're chasing a fleeing mob up the tunnel; you HAVE to aggro all the mobs that spawn.  The first wave is pretty easy, only three, but the next wave had five, and then a couple additional adds respawned in the hallway I originally cleared to get to the quest giver.  What finally worked for me was waiting at the slight bend in the tunnel where the waves spawn, quickly sapping one, tagging each of the other spawns to keep them on me, and killing the geomancers first.

If you look around a little, the dragons respawn quicker than one person can kill them all. The drop rate, I admit, is pretty bad. But if you go at a time when server traffic is low (aka Not Prime Time) you should have no compitition for this quest and the drops will seem more frequent.\

Of course, they're casters, and it's in tight quarters, so while you try to pull them away, chances are they'll be tossing shadowbolts at the back of your head. \

I suspect ranged characters (nukers and hunters) will have better luck with this place.  They can CC the voidwalker pets if need be, and then just out-DPS the warlocks.  The warlocks don't run around, I assume, if you're not getting up into melee range. \

the trick for me was to kill the 2 warlocks at the bottom floor, always send pet in first. After that i had no trouble walking in withouth aggro, use eyes of the beast to control your pet, walk him up to the first warlock then let him run down far enough for you to be in line of sight. Do this all the way up, i had no trouble doing this, not even with the top level, i could easily get the 2 at the stairs, regain health and mana.\
Last thing, send your pet to one of the warlocks next to Athrikus, this will also aggro him, but that's allright as long as you remember to slow down the warlock so it doesn't run !\
Kill the warlock, then Athrikus and last the voidwalker, and voila you've got the head. No harm done :)",

At L30, the two warlocks at the base of the tower were still able to combine and kill me. Tonight the right warlock would just evade, but I think that I could have taken the pair.\
\
The warlocks will always attack before their minions. Routine was shield, dot, dot, manaburn, manaburn, wand if needed. re-shield, dot, wand the minion.  Only one warlock would attack at a time. I was able to single pull all warlock/minion pairs, just walking around the tower. If I could not easily target the warlock, I would let them attack to establish a target, as the warlock would always attack before sending their pet.  If you attack from a distance with a spell or probably an arrow, attacking the warlocks adjacent to Athrikus did not aggro him, although that might have been a level thing - a lower level might have a higher aggro radius.  In any case I never want to go into that silly tower again, at least with this toon.  \
\
There were respawns before I started down the tower. I could go down one stair while they were on the other without aggroing and kill the ones I had to. I would not do that on the way up because I was worried about him calling his minions for help but there had already been repops on the lower levels that did not interfere.",

Also, since these are ghosts, they're kind of hard to spot underwater, so you might want to hit tab [to target the closest enemy] quite frequently, to be safe.\

For those with Cosmos or map coordinates, the mill is at 66,50.  There are two loggers close to it, so take them out.  Then attach the explosives, blow it up, and run along the bottom of the hill towards the mill.  Not all of the Venture guys will leave, but that's okay.  The plans are on the west/left side of the mill, on a tree stump.  It looks like a piece of rolled-up parchment.  I shifted to cat from as soon as it blew, prowled over to the parchment, shifted up, grabbed it, and ran out with only 1 aggro - Deforester - to take care of behind the mill. \

    "10796648630664862007/04/13 08:06:15skyoverheavenI just wanted to note that when doing this quest, you don't actually need to use the explosives/detonator -- but it's kind of fun, so do it anyway.  The quest items are right out in plain sight, so all the explosives do is make it easier for you to go in and grab the item needed. So if you were like me and detonated the explosives and then wondered what the heck to do next (I was searching in the wrong area, eep!), have no fear, you can just clear the mobs the old fashioned way and nab the quest item.\
\
This is fairly straight forward. You can see the lumber mill from the entrance of Windshear Crag, and right in front of it is a small wagon of explosives. Kill any mobs near the wagon then set the blue explosives (by right clicking on the blue explosives in your bags). There's no timer on the explosives, so don't feel like you have to rush out as soon as you place it.\
\
To the left of the front of the lumber mill (looking from the wagon) is a crate with a clickable item -- these are the plans you need. Move away a bit from the wagon, edging up to the crate -- but not too far as the detonator has a pretty small radius to work (I think like 20 yards). When you're ready, use your blue detonator (click it in your bags) and the wagon of explosives will... well, explode. The mobs in the mill will run out to see what's going on -- unfortunately, it's mostly the mobs from the front/inside, and this doesn't help much as the mobs you want are on the left. But it's less to clear, so clear the 2-3 mobs left around the crate, zip in, snag the quest item, and zip out before the crowd comes back to the mill. Personally, I think the explosives sort of complicate things more than needed, but explosions are always fun I suppose.",

    "25361422150614222007/04/03 05:44:06ParynAs a level 33 shadow priest, I believe it's possible to solo Eliza. I (as a level 33 shadow priest) was able to bring her to around 80% health, before a random Shaman jumped in to help and finish her off. But, to be honest, I did not need any help.\
\
Here is the synopsis of the strategy I used:\
1) Run a little distance from grave after opening. \
2) Shackle Eliza.\
3) Mind blast Eliza.\
4) repeat step 2\
\
Here is the strategy in a little more detail.\
\
As many people have already mentioned above, Eliza does two things: She will cast frostbolt / frostnova and during the encounter she will summon three undead guardians, whom I believe are level 29. \
\
Because she will try to frostbolt you when you are out of melee range, the basic idea of my strategy was to cast a direct damage spell on her, then immediately shackle her before she can finish casting frostbolt.\
\
The shackling has the affects of interrupting her spell casting, allowing you some time to regenerate mana, and preventing her from summoning her undead friends.\
\
That's basically all there is to it. When she's shackled, she can't summon her friends. When she's casting frostbolt, she can't summon her friends. \
\
A few things to note. You want to cast a quick damage spell, like mind blast or smite. If you mind flay, you will probably not have the time to shackle her before her frostbolt finishes casting. You also don't want to use a spell like Shadow Word: Pain, for obvious reasons (You are using shackle!). You also probably want to wait for the \"Five Second Rule\" http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Mana_Regen#Five_Second_Rule to fade so that you regenerate some mana. Else, if you decide to spam shackle / mind blast, you run the risk of running out of mana. \
\
Good luck.",

I was able to take her out this way, solo, as a 33 shaman, specced Enhancement (no nuking bonuses).  I put down a frost resistance totem and a mana spring and just kept lobbing Lightning Bolts at her.  I neglected to keep Lightning Shield up, but I imagine it would help significantly. \
\
I tried a more legitimate approach twice before, but wasn't able to take her out before her three guards took me out.  \
\
One odd thing I found was that, while on the roof, if you let up on the damage for a few moments too many, she leaves 'combat mode' and her health and mana shoot back up to 100%.  I found this puzzling, as I was still within range of her, but oh well, no biggie.  Just let your mana recharge and try again.",

The axe with its 3.6 speed has the highest max damage, hence your abilities (like heroic strike, MS etc etc) will hurt lots more with the axe than any of the other 2 options.\

I did this at level 22 solo so it is definetly doable. Some tips to doing this are that if you have to fight mobs in a group try pulling them near the entrance to the instance. Kill one of them and zone out. Eat + drink and come back in and repeat until you have cleared that pull. For the part where you free the guy from the cell, you can just jump down and free him and if you die he will still open the gate for you. In the couryard, work on clearing the left wall so that you have a clear path to the stables.

\
Whitestone Oak Lumber:  This is dropped from the goblin woodworkers inside deadmines inside the mast making room.  Its the room with the large logs stacked around.\
\
Jordans Refined Ore Shipment:  This will require an additional quest acuired from Bailor Stonehand inside Thelsamar.  http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=6241  Hes down stairs inside the house with the tailoring merchant outside.  Once you acuire the quest the ore can be found from a box at aproximetly 71,21\
http://www.wowhead.com/?object=92420  Return the box to Stonehand and he will give you the refined Ore.\
\
Jordans Smithing Hammer:  No additional quest is needed.  You will need to travel to Silverpine Forest to Shadowfang keep which is located just north of Pyrewood Village.  You will find the hammer inside the stables located in the courtyard of the instance.\
http://atlasmod.com/Maps/ShadowfangKeep.jpg\
The stablesare located just north of the letter B on the map.  If you are around lvl 20 you will either need a full group or a lvl 60 to get you to that area.\
\
Purified Core Gem:  The final piece requires that you travel to Kalimador.  You will need to take the boat from menethil to Darnassus (Teldrassil).  Be sure to stop by the gryphon masters to acuire new flightpaths.  You will need to take the boat from Teldrassil to darkshore which is just on the otherside of the dock.  Once in darkshore speak with Thundris Windreaver in Auberdine http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=3649  After getting the quest \"Seeking the Kor Gem\"  Head south to Ashenvale and the entrence to Blackfathom Deeps is located around 15,15.  Its located inside the ruins of a temple, you will see a pit with water at the bottom and stairs taking you down to it.  Once you are in teh water dive and you will find that you can swim under one of the walls and actually enter Blackfathom Deeps.  You will not have to travel deep inside, it usually drops off the second or third Wrathtail.  Once you have the gem travel back to Thundris Windreaver.\

Do not attack the ogre so it loses aggro.  Once it does, the ogre will not have a clear path back to it's starting location.  It will then freeze and become temporarily evasion bugged.

    "5407312107312006/09/19 18:04:20peeweeswedenThis quest is easily soloable as lvl 34, regardless of your class. I've done it as rogue, druid, warrior and hunter. As rogue and druid it's of course easier, since you have stealth, but the way you do it is basically the same: \
\
Enter the ruins from the WEST, not on the road. Go to the Growless cave (38,68) and continue around the ruins clock-wise. There are some lvl 32-34 yetis roaming there, no big deal. Avoid or crush. When you are directly west of the ruins you will see a part of the wall with a hole in it. Enter there and very very carefully negotiate the ogres in there. They are 38-39 elites. I walk along the northern-most mountainside inside the compound. Your goal is *not* the main building, but the smaller house with a belltower. There is one ogre that'll probably aggro on you. If he does, run behind the target building and continue along the mountainside until he drops, or simply stand behind the house and let him smash you. Resurrect on that spot, behind the house. \
From above, the house looks like a \"T\" with a short base. \
\
X marks the spot you're looking for. Move the cursor along the wall until you see it shift into the \"use\"-cursor. That's the bookshelf you're looking for. Simply right-click it to get the book, right through the house wall! Negotiate your way out from the compaund the way you came. If you get aggro, make a run for it and die in a good spot (there is a space in the wall you got through at its northen-most end where you can exit and the ogres won't follow you outside)\

Get to that belltower, but take off all your gear (besides things that can't take damage, like rings, capes, shirts, etc) incase you die. If something aggro's onto you, you have the oppertunity to get away from it no matter which ogre it is (unless you're stupid, and didn't follow along the wall as the first poster indicated you should do). Usually running behind a building will get you out of dodge if you're in trouble. Anyway, once inside the building with the book you need, you have to deal with that damn 40 elite, Muckrake. Put your gear back on. The trick is to go into Defensive Stance, press Bloodrage, walk in to the room with the bookcase and Muckrake, get 25 rage, then hit Intimidating Shout. If the fear works, you got JUST enough time to run to the bookcase and get your book, if you did this in the very center of the room. If your fear is resisted just run out of the building and to the right until he goes away. Once you finally loot the book you need, run out the way you came in until Muckrake goes away. \

Then I read some of your replies and mixed them a bit.\
What I did =\
1) Clear NE part of isle\
2) Kill the fighter add\
     - I used Gift of Naruu, then the reduce dmg totem, then I used lightning bolt, then Earth shock, then I began to fight him and used Earth shock whenever I could, then I healed myself once and casted the slow totem, then ran.\
3) Kill the mage add\
    - I used the reduce dmg totem and casted lightning bolt and used lesser healing once or twice, then ran..\
4) Kill ruuzel\

Trying to get an opener off on these guys is nearly an exercise in futility. So ridiculous. If you manage to sap one you can stand by them and the debuff will keep refreshing over and over while they are sapped. In Dark Age of Camelot we called these types of spells pulsing PBAoEs I believe. This is the only one I have seen in WoW, though I would bet there are a few more.\
\
Edit - Best thing to do as a rogue is spam your opener as you get close. The range of the debuff seems to be a little shorter than melee range, so you can get your move off right as you get in range without getting knocked out of stealth. Also, I believe Ursas and Den Watchers debuff stamina rather than strength. One of them does at the least. Pathfinders debuff agility.",

You might want to get full health points before going further, you got time to bandage or eat. He is easy, put a rend, demo-shout, use retaliation (if you are desperate) and he is down. Does not hit that hard either, around ~40 and crits ~70 (with demo-shout on).\

As a lvl 30 fury/arms spec with several blues, the wyverns (lvl 28-29) prooved to put up a decent fight. And doing this quest without killing them is impossible, as they aggro far enough away that charging them is really difficult. On top of that, the shells you need are far apart and there's not that many of them, so you get to run around the place a couple times, killing a whole bunch of the wyverns.\
\
As of patch 2.3, the shells shimmer, making them a lot easier to find, and thanks to the lowered amount of XP needed to level, you may just gain a level or two killing your way through all the wyverns.\
\
Overall, soloable at lvl 30, but bring plenty of food and/or bandages. And be very careful taking on more than one wyvern at the time, they hit a lot harder than you'd think, and they poison you which slows down your attacks.",

\
\"+Damage is superior to stats at all levels, especially while leveling. Increasing your mana pool only extends the amount of downtime, and the increase to crit is negligible; the exception is Imp. Drain Soul, and in this case, mana pool only needs to be large enough to make the talent worthwhile. You only need enough stamina to take a few hits, and alternatively, spell damage is a great way to boost survivability because Drain Life, Siphon Life, and Life Tap all scale with +damage.\
\
I'm level 31 now, with 65 spell damage. No downtime, and I kill mobs very quickly.\"\
\
My own Warlock is personally at 120 +shadow dam at 32 (some twinking done with a 70 main) and stuff just dies. There is no subsitute for +spell damage, because it is the only thing that shortens your time in combat, hence shortening the time you use your resource pool (health and mana).",

Had to pull the guys out & have the pirates fight them- even just the hits they got in while running down to the pirates almost killed me. Only the blackwater deckhands will aggro, so its a bit of a run while they're both trying to frost nova you. \
The prof won't die fighting one of them for a few min, but he will if you let him fight both. Learned this after dying twice trying to get both of them at once(for some reason they really like fighting the prof!). Instead I used fire blast on one of them, blinked down to the blackwater raiders, and ran back up and did the same thing with the other one. Once I figured that out wasn't nearly so difficult.\

Take your time while taking the mob guards out.  Watch out for the shadowcasters, however, as they can catch you off guard.  Of course, should you engage one, you'll need to take care of him and his skeleton minion to proceed. \
\
Nek'rosh is down the hill from the catapults in a kind of fortress of the hills.  You can kill him fairly easily by vaulting the hills around him and coming at him from behind.  (Watch for guards on top of the hills and at least one shadowcaster on one side up higher). Pull Nek'rosh from behind and you will most likely only pull one or two of the guards, at most, with him.  I was able to pull him away from the surrounding mob with a couple of range shot arrows; then got him alone on top of the hill behind his garrison.  \"Chieftain\" Nek'rosh gave me a fight, but nothing that my lvl 30 warrior couldn't handle. \

Mobs respawn fairly quickly, so try not to move too slow. There are also stealthed mobs and patrolling mobs, so keep an eye out for them.\
\
Once you're in, Taneel is in the room across the first bridge you come across. The mobs before him can be single pulled. He's a priest with a fairly painful Shadow Word: Pain and his Heal heals him pretty much to full health, so just watch for those.\
\
For Mavoris, go down the ramp to the left and take your first left. Follow the tunnel to the bridge that leads into the middle of a cavern with a bridge directly opposite. Cross both those brides and follow the tunnel. Mavoris is at the end. He has two mobs in front of him that pull together. Take them out and then Mavoris is easy.\
\
For Uthil, go back to the room with the two bridges opposite each other and go down the ramp. Take the first tunnel to your right. Follow it, go down the ramp to your left and take the first tunnel to your left. Uthil is the bear in the room at the end of that tunnel and is fairly straight foward to defeat.",

You can come in either end of this but the path up the hill to him is at the bottom of the \"U\". The patrols are singles with an occasional felhound and felguard pair. I just used a freeze trap on the pairs with my pet on passive and pulling both to me and freezing one. Once you start up the short hill path, there is a felguard at the top. He is not linked to anything and you can pull him down the path safely. Go to the top of the path and look at the camp area where you will find the boss in the middle and his succubus next to him. In front of him on each side is a felhound (fellslayer is the name I think). They are NOT linked to anything. Wait until each one paths as far from the boss and just range pull each one back near the top of the path you just came up. Now you are faced with just the boss warlock and the succubus. I laid a freeze trap at my feet, hunter's mark on the boss, and sent my pet onto the Succubus next to the boss. I poured everything I had onto the boss and killed him as he summoned 2 voidwalkers. The succubus was at half health and so was my pet so I focused fire on her as 1 of the voidwalkers hit the freeze trap. The voidwalkers do very little damage so I ingnored the remaining one until the succubus was dead. The pet immediately attacked the voidwalker on me and I wing clipped it and ran to range. We killed it and the one just breaking out of the trap. My pet was at half health and so was I. There was no need to bandage or use a pot for me during the fight.
