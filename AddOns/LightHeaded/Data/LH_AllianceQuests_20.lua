At the end of both bridges are little caves with the chests that hold the relics. Careful: There are usually two guys within the caves and there's one (that's possibly on both) that patrols the bridge to your left. \
\
--After that, keep following the tunnel. There will be a place to go infront of you, and tunnel leading off to the right that looks like it \"spiral's\" down. Follow the spiral tunnel. You will eventually come to another bridge that you may cross. There is no relic inside this cave, but a quest. Its up to you if you want to get it. The guy's name is Rageclaw, if I recall correctly... \
**If you do go straight ahead, this will take you to a platform. \
\
--Now, on that plat form, there's usually a guy standing in the middle, and one that patrols the bridge leading to the platform and another patrolling the little bridge that leads you down, along with another that walks on the other bridge straight ahead (or almost) of you. That's where you want to go. It's like a cave - when you first walk in there's approx. 2 guys in that little 'bubble'. There's a tunnel to your right which you want to take. That takes you to another 'bubble' in which there's approx. 2 more guys. Once you kill them, turn to the right and there's your chest with one of the relics sitting out on a 'deck' (looks like one, as it has a railing...). \
**If you didn't go straight ahead, don't worry. \
\
--If you get the quest, that's alright. Now, there's going to be another opening straight ahead, and once more, another that spirals down. Take the spiral first - There's another relic down there. This one is by that beloved Greenpaw dude...whatever his name is...Anyways, there's him (usually lvl 10ish or so) along with a lvl 8, 7, or 9. Once you're done there, move back up the spiral and take the opening on your right. Follow that. You'll come to a little arena-like area. There'll be a large pillar of stone in the middle, with guys walking around it. There IS a little cave bubble down there, but it HAS NO RELIC. This is where rageclaw's body lurks, so he might attack you. He patrols around the pillar. Now, there should be a little pathway to your left, taking you up to the platform. Kill the guys there. (I've describe approx. how many guys are there in the lil dot thing above this one.) You're going to want to take the bridge to your right, leading you into The cave bubble. Kill the guys there and take the one to your left to the next bubble, kill those guys. To your right is the 'deck' with your relic\

in the middle of that hallway area there is a 4th set of steps take a left and you will see a glowing emblem on the floor, that is the summoning place.\

\
Started in Darkshire and ran to rebel camp in STV to cap the FP. Started running towards BB to cap the FP and sail from there, but failed misserably. Got killed by the tiger that always hides behind the first bush when you enter the \"actual\" STV, and got ganked by a lvl ?? the sec I ress. (was lvl 20 at the time) \"Uh!!! I can do a ghost run all teh way to BB, and even get there faster then\" i thought to myself. And i did it. Got to BB 50% faster, and clicked the spirit healer, and got portet back to the northern STV with ress sickness and an angry tiger next to me.\
\
Then my brain kicked in and i remembered that i could SWIM all the way down there, so I flew to westfall, ran to the coast and swam all the way without even a small NPC in the way. Capped the FP and took the boat.\
\
I arrived happily in Ratchet and capped the FP just to be sure. Moved along the road with auto-walk, and turned my brain off because, \"What could happen to me? It's just The Barrens!\" 2 seconds later I got ganked by a lvl 16 rogue as I was drinking my coffee. After a really long detour around any horde player I could see, I finally got to the blind dude, and did the quest.\
\
Apparentley I threw my brain out teh window as I completed teh quest, because I thought it would be easier to take a shortcut through XR. Boy was i wrong. After some painfull ressing atempts I got on the way to Astralala (or what ever it's called) and capped teh FP there. Stupid as I was I started to fight my way through all the furbolgs instead of following the road because i thought it was a shortcut. Wrong again.\
\
I got to the Heartswood quite painless (Zero kills) after that, and moved along towards Auberdine then. Didn't notice I ran into a Raid on Auberdine untill i read \"You are dead, 6 minutes untill release\" DO'H!!!\
\
Ressed, Sailed to Menethil, flew to SW, completed the quest, Took teh follow-up, killed the succubus, dinged 21, got the summoning spell and (I still regret this part) then banged my head on the desk.\

\
I then went east into the Barrens, taking the northern way around the guard post and then going along the road - avoiding Crossroads to go down to near Camp Turajo and get this part of the quest.\
\
From there I went up to Ratchet, got the flight path, got on the boat to Booty Bay and go the Flight Path to that (at level 20 - you have no chance of walking through STV, so this is a great chance to get that flight path early). Taking the boat back I flew from Ratchet to Astranaar and then walked up to the treem hugging the 'wall' so that I never got any aggro.\

1: Go to westfall, Saldean's Farm.\
2: Create a macro with the line /chicken .\
3: Target one of the chickens at Saldean's Farm and spam the macro (this might take a while, be patient).\
4: Eventually, the chicken will become green-labeled, rightklick the chicken (I presume your not level 1) and you will recive a quest - this quest.\
5: Accept the quest, go to \"Farmer Saldean\" and buy one piece of Special Chicken Feed.\
6: Return to the chicken and give him the Special Chicken Feed - he will give you a \"Chicken Egg\" (you have to pick it up yourself) - this egg is a pet :)\
\
This quest is A   H but the special chicken feed is only buyable for the Alliance (you might be able to get it by the cross-faction AH).\

    "9476531131344182007/04/11 02:30:05IcemeltJust FYI: Spawn times are now based on how fast you kill consecutive mobs. I don't know the \"magic\" on this system, but it seems that (upon late experimentation) if you take your time killing mobs and eat/bandage between kills, the mobs spawn slightly slower.\
\
Also, non-looting still works, but spawn times are not 2x as long like before patch 2.x\
\
(note: non-looting = not touching the loot 'sparkles' until you have cleared an area causing the spawn system to slow down to allow you time to loot)",
    "947182441301824412007/11/11 14:23:14NivraxHunters are somewhat different, at lvl10 they got pet (which on that low level is much tougher even than a Warlocks WV) and with Mend Pet they are able to solo easily most of the quests, even harder ones (one man army - a tank pet, Mend Pet healer and a dpser which ranged skills).\
\
The mobs inside cave ARE hard. Either warriors, which are doing quite a bit damage and cast some sort of spell that knocks you back, interrupting action and, if you are really unlucky, dropping you down to 100% death. Priestes on the other hand casts Smite dealing about 40 holy dmg and when low on hp, heal (that is giving them 100% health back). Add to that big density of mobs there and that Nagas will try to flee, bringing more and more adds (and don`t forget about one or two patrols) and you will get one small hell.\
\
I done this quest 3 times and each time I was able to solo it by going right way (tho at the end I always ended up fighting 2 mobs). However, today (when I was doing this as a 15lvl druid) there was no Death Cap on right side (I figured it out after 20minutes of fight and 2 deaths...). 1 hour later I returned there with a 3 man party and somehow we menaged to get to the Mushrooms (3 of them) located below. However, that way is close to imposible (if not impossible for most classes) to solo due to numerours Nagas and the Twilight Thugs.\
\
In short words - you can try to solo it going the right way BUT if there are no Mushroom, either get a party, a hight level (20 or so) or forget about it.",
    "94714491231344182007/08/27 14:22:26drakaWhen I soloed this cave as a 16 druid, I was the only one in the entire area, so the mob respawn rate was reasonable (because killing things in bear form takes time). \
\
So long as there isn't competition, just go to the right \"upper\" deck like others suggested and by the time you singly defeat the naga and get a death cap (there are actually three), a couple other stalks back at the entrance will have respawned. Don't bother with going into the rest of the cave.\
\
I recommend backing into a wall when facing the melee wave riders since they'll kick you a fair distance.  Watch for patrols, of course, and be sure to kill them quickly at the end since they'll run away and look for friends. This is annoying in caves.",
    "9476534740653472007/04/11 05:23:47IcemeltThis quest is not hard, but can be if you get careless. Your best course of action, due to the faster spawn times, is to take your time and have your Hearthstone ready when you complete. Otherwise you'll be killing your way out.\
\
If you're lucky, you'll get the Death Cap on the upper floor as apposed to inside the cavern deeps.\
\
Warning!: Unless you are sure of yourself and your skill/level, do not attempt to kill the Twilight Thugs. The drop rate for the quest giving book is extremely low. \"IF\" you decide to take them on, your best bet is to use some immoblizing effect on one of the Twilight Thugs and Nuke the caster/healer. You may die at this point. Run back as quickly as possible, immobilize the lower of the two Twilight Thugs and Nuke the other. You 'MAY' die again (this is why it's not worth it to me). Run back quickly, kill the last, hope the healer doesen't respawn, because you 'MAY' die again! If the Twilight Thugs are orange to you, don't even try. I suggest not trying unless at least one of them (probably the healer) is green. (This is based on a Rogue's perspective and may change with other classes.)",

If you're having problems getting enough Watchers to kill, try branching out a little, and maybe doing more than one quest at once.",

I did not have any helpful flightpaths yet so this is how I did it.\

Flew to Westfall, then swam from there to Booty Bay. Just kept good distance to the shore and no one disturbed me.\
Took the FP in BB and then went on the boat from there to Ratchet and ran to Takar the Seer (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=6244) from there.\
\
After this, first instinct would be to run north, but instead I took my HS back to IF and ran to Westfall and grabbed my FP there and then hopped on the boat to Darkshore got the FP and ran from there to the tree.\
\
Finished my bussiness there, killed about 4 of them, then continued to Astranaar and took the FP there.\

\
Earlier in the game, get the Menethil Harbor flight path, then take the boat to Auberdine.  Get the flight path from there and proceed on foot to Astranaar and get the flight path and Hearthstone there as well as you'll need it to get back. \
\
Next, go from there south and follow the road east towards Raynewood retreat and continue past it until you come to a road on the right, which takes you south into the barrens. The Road is between Raynewood and the Splintertree outpost...just so you know, there is a Horde outpost at the entrance to the barrens, but     if you bare left, you'll find a hole in the outpost wall you can traverse and avoid the guards altogether. \
\
Travel onward into the barrens via the gold road...a 2nd outpost at the crossroads is here so go around. You'll reach your goal in no time. \
\
Once you get the quest to obtain the Heartswood, use your Hearthstone and go back to Astranaar...go to the ruins of Ordil'Aran and approach from the south. I only had to take out 2 Dark Strands and moved along the edge of the mountain to get the Heartswood as you don't have to be right upon it to interact with the tree. It helps to do it that way so you avoid causing other Dark Strands from attacking you.  \
\
Now, reverse your way back to Stormwind, visit Gakin, beat down the succubus...visit Gakin again. Enjoy your succubus..\
\
This is the way I did it, and was nearly hastle-free. I sicked my Voidwalker on the succubus and just sat back and watched the fight.",

I just followed these steps today (Aug 26, 2007).  When I read all of the comments here, I got a little confused.  Hopefully this will help.  If not, feel free to rate it down.\
\
Basically, as soon as you take the quest, grab one of the lunchbox-looking things (Chest of Containment Coffers) and one of the scrolls (Cantation of Manifestation) from the table next to Jennea Cannon.  \
\
Head to the Blue Recluse (approximately at 38,84).  If you're entering the Mage Quarter from the Trade District and you take the southern path inside the quarter after the tunnel, it should be the first building on your left.  But, you'll probably be heading there from the Mage's Tower, so as soon as you get outside, jump off the right side and you should see the building.  \
\
Then, follow the advice of adders666 (six posts above this one).  I followed his instructions and it worked perfectly.  To reiterate, summon the first one in the basement, then go up the stairs and summon from within the fireplace, then go into the main room and go under one of the staircases to summon.  For each summon, once you've stunned the creature, use the Chest of Containment Coffers.  This will throw a coffer onto the ground and the creature will become trapped in it.  Pick up the coffer once it's filled.  Do this for each creature.  Once you have three of them, head back to Jennea.",

Go back to the kitchen for the 3rd\

\
There are plenty of individual agents & Sabotures walking amongst the area.  Picking off these just takes patience and making your attacks from higher ground... The mountain ridges make excelent cover to walk all the way to the top of the coil mountain.  Not to mention that if you can handle picking off a few here and there, going to complete another mission and coming back to take out the respawns you should find this a relatively easy solo at lvl 19 or 20.  \
\
Bare in mind that since ALL of the Blood Elves here are Elites, they are little b's to kill anyway, but, again... some time and patients and taking it on solo is not a big deal.",

\
First: there's a rare stealthed assassin running around.  Make sure she dies before you attempt soloing others.  The assassin is not elite, only silver.\
\
Second: just because it looks like there's only one mob there from one angle doesn't mean that there's actually only one.  There are a couple points where they spawn in a straight line on the path most travelled, most notably the very first set as you start heading up the hill.\
\
Third: if you aren't a hybrid class, this is going to be rough.  Healing is a major perk if you're dealing with elites.  What I knew would be a trivial exercise in patience on my druid turned into a major, delicate task on my new warrior.\
\
As for my specific strategy: If you pass the first group of two elves over the hills on the left, you'll come to a saboteur.  These don't have ranged attacks.  Make sure you're all clear (see above note on assassin), pull it with a crossbow, then just go to work.  Keep battle and demoralizing shouts up, thunder clap, sunder armor, rend--anything you can do to balance out the elite advantage without slowing your attacks.  If you're soloing, heroic strike isn't the best use for your rage until near the end of the fight.  Use Gift of the Naaru before you're on death's doorstep.  It's not like you're going to be able to save it for next fight if you have no other healing skills.  Wait for Gift to come off cooldown, then look to the agent straight up the hill past where you pulled the saboteur.  Agents have bows, so you have to charge that one and hope that the patrol from further up the hill doesn't see you.  Once in melee range, the fight is exactly like the saboteur, just different skills that you can't do much about coming at you.",

What? You don't have a fishing outfit yet? ;-)\
\
This all started with Draznar's Fishing FAQ (http://wow.toshimo.com/viewtopic.php?t=272). In the FAQ, he highlights some of the more fashionable fishing items you can wear. When the addon \"Fishing Buddy\" (http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=1095) came out, he gave style points based on Draznar's Fishing FAQ. So if you want to maximize your \"style points\", then you'll want to hang onto this shirt.\
\
Does this really DO anything for your fishing? No, but it is fun and makes fishing a little more interesting. :-)\

\
Get the quest from the first outpost as you cross the bridge onto Bloodmyst Isle, then turn around and run back to Azuremyst isle. \
\
first stop - Stillpine chief outside of stillpine hold\
second stop - Exarch menelaous - on the hill just to the northwest of the town of Azurewatch, in the middle of the island.\
Third Stop - Admiral Odesyus, in Odesyus' landing, at the bottom of the island.\
\
with the elekk mount speed, you can do this in less than 6 minutes, meaning that you can spend the next 8 minutes running around on a mount :)",

    "30341876034182006/11/11 02:44:40madroxePart 1:\
\
The local in Moonglade whom you can to speak with is the flight master, Silva Fil'naveth.  She'll tell you to head out to Darkshore for one half of the pendant.  Fly or hearth to Darkshore, then head north up the road near the Cliffspring River.  Once you get near it, start heading north out to the shore, then into the ocean.  Swim out to 48, 11. You'll see a large, gray rock sticking out of the water. But before you go for the seal, you'll probably need to deal with the Elder Threshers first.  Once you eliminate them, swim to the north side of the rock and down to the bottom and retrieve the seal from the chest. Congrats!  You've completed the first half of the quest... \
\
Part 2:\
The next half of the pendant can be found in the Westfall area. To get to Westfall, you have about a 45 minute run ahead of ya., Let me get you headed in the right direction. \
\
In Auberdine, run past the innkeeper onto the pier and run down it until you can make a left or right. Go left to the end of the pier and take the boat to Menethil Harbor.  Once there, run to shore and talk to Shellei Brondir (the gryphon master) to get the flight path. Then go north out of the harbor into the Wetlands, and STAY ON THE ROAD!!! (chances are you aren't of level to be doing stuff here yet, and if you wander off you may find a quick trip to your grave. Lots of hungry crocs around ;)\
Follow the road all the way east and down to the southern part of the Wetlands map until the road takes a last minute turn west which leads to Dun Algaz (54,70).  Go through the tunnel, out onto the road, into another tunnel (repeat like 3 or 4 times).  Just keep on the road. **CAUTION! Be on the lookout for Dragonmaw Grunts and Scouts (orcs). There are a couple who hang out near the road, and chances are good that they will attack.  If you can, get a root off on them and go.**\
As you go through the last tunnel, you'll enter the land of Loch Modan.  Follow the road south until you get to about 32,49 - just outside the town of Thelsamar. Head just SE off the road to a dwarf named Thorgrum Borrelson (gryphon master) to get access to the flight path, which you will be thankful for later on.\
\
Hop back on the road and continue south to about 23,70 where you will probably see a traveling merchant, and take a right on that road.  Follow it and go through the South Gate Pass, which takes you out to the snowy area of Dun Morogh.  Follow the road west all the way down until you get to coords 37,44.  Now make a right and cross the small bridge, then head up the hill to get to Ironforge. Once inside, open up your map and head to the center of it to the Great Forge.  Look for another gryphon master just next to it and speak with him for the flight path here (Gryth Thurden).  Now open up your map again, and head to the area known as Tinker Town, which leads you into the zone portal for the Deeprun Tram.  Take the Tram which takes you to Stormwind.  Open your map again and head to the Trade District, then look for gryphon master Dungar Longdrink.  Speak to him for the flight path then do a 180 and dive off into the water.  Swim past the Valley of Heroes then get to shore and run up and out of the entrance gates into Elwynn Forest.  As SOON as you leave the gates, make an immediate right and follow the Elwynn border all the way SW until you hit the road again, then make a right on the road to enter Westfall.  Go down the road until you see gryphon master Thor off the right side of the road near Sentinel Hill.  Talk to him then head straight west, off of the road, past the mobs onto the shore and into the waters of The Great Sea.  Swim out to 17,32 dive down deep until you see a bubbly fissure.  As you approach it for air, open up the chest and grab the second half of the pendant.  Now it's time to go put it together. Off to Moonglade we go! Teleport!!\
\
Once in Moonglade, run west towards the Shrine of Remulos again.  Hit your Moonglade teleport one more time. [con't]",

When you approach the compound, you'll notice a building on the south side. this is where the Umbral Ore is located. Dark Iron Spies are spaced wide enough apart that you can pull each one individually.\

After making your way inside of the building, you'll find Captain Beld located in the basement. He is standing right next to a chest that contains the Umbral Ore. Beware, as soon as he sees you, he will charge you, so any rush attacks will have to be quick. Once Captain Beld is killed, simply open the chest and retreive the ore.\
\
For those of you with Cosmos or Titan Panel add-ons, the coordinates are 77,62 for the chest.\

You must Speak with Duthorian Rall and he will give you the Tome of Valor. Read the book and he will give you the next quest. The next step is to go to Daphne Stillwell in Westfall. (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=6182)\
\
To get to her you have to go West towards the shore and past Daggerhills. This is the pass in the mountains where you had to kill a bunch of Defias. You have to go up to the exit of the Deadmines and go passed it until you see a house down a slope. Daphne is in the small field in front of the house.\
\
You will have to defend her against waves of Defias. It can be soloed pretty easily, heal Daphne to keep her alive while you dispatch the Defias.\
\
Upon completion, return  to Stormwind to the trainer and you will receive your ability to Sense Undead and the shield Bastion of Stormwind (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=9607)\
\
The paladin trainer will then instruct you to go to Jordan Stilwell. He is at the Gates of Ironforge (52,36). He will give you the quest The test of righteousness (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1653)\

I did this quest as a rogue, i just stealth-sapped them (as of 2.1 sap doesn't break stealth), picked them, looted, sapped them again (in case they woke up before i started running) and then ran away.

    "73172082072082006/12/06 09:33:47MAVCMage / Druid combo is the way that I did this one.  The mage went ahead and cleared mobs before the prospector aggroed them,   and I (druid) stayed on the prospector to heal.  I'd throw a small heal on the mage every once in a while.  Also buffed the prospector with MotW and thorns.  He aggroed twice but I quickly took them off of him.  Real easy to do.",
    "731152829401528292007/09/14 09:45:59ChairmanKagaThis quest can be soloed as long as you know what to expect and can be prepared for it.  I just pulled it off with a level 21 mage.  I wouldn't recommend trying to solo this before 20.  This quest is easily done with two people, but if you're stuck on your own, I hope this helps get you through it.\
\
First, note that Remtravel is indeed oblivious.  He will not attack unless he is personally aggroed first, otherwise he will keep walking the scripted route.  Mobs attacking you are not his concern.  Mobs you aggro yourself will be ignored as well.  If you let him lead, he will draw the initial aggro and stop.  This can be useful if you need a few seconds to catch your breath, but don't leave him alone too long -- he can't solo these mobs and he can't withstand too much punishment from them.  If more than one mob is on him, you need to intervene quickly.  AoE attacks are useful here, as he rarely accumulates much threat and any decent damage will get the mobs onto you instead.\
\
Second, avoid the use of snares (Frost Nova, Entangling Roots, etc).  If you snare and attempt to pull back for a more opportune attack, the mobs will drop threat on you and switch to something else in melee range -- Remtravel.\
\
Now to tell you what to expect, besides the golems infesting the whole place.\
\
When you begin the escort, there are a couple tents straight ahead and a ramp and scaffold along the right side.  Remtravel will eventually walk up that ramp.  This cues a single trogg to spawn.  This trogg always seems to ignore Remtravel and go for you, so be prepared to dispatch it quickly so Remtravel doesn't get too far ahead of you.\
\
Shortly after this, he will investigate Hollee's tent (he will comment \"Oh, that's Hollee's tent, and it's empty\")  Two troggs will spawn from the back right corner of the camp and go for Remtravel.\
\
Now he will start walking down into the more open area of the dig site.  At the far end, straight ahead, is another ramp and scaffold, with a small hill to the left.  Remember this spot.\
\
His path will take him down into the dig site, to the left and back around the other side of the wall to the dead end, then turn around and start heading back out to the start point.  On his way out, he will investigate that ramp and scaffold I mentioned earlier.  When he does, this will trigger two troggs to spawn on the hill to the left, one of them being a caster that likes Fireball.  The caster will drop Remtravel in two shots, so you need to draw its aggro [i]immediately[/i].  Personally I stood on the hill and cast Fire Blast on it while it was spawning.  Even so, it will get one Fireball off on Remtravel before switching to you (both troggs aggro Remtravel immediately upon spawning), so you also need to get the melee trogg off of him and then take them both down before they manage to kill you instead.\
\
If you get past this, you're pretty much clear, you just have to get him back to the front, past the few golems that have respawned, but those should be easy compared to what you just did.",

\
On my fourth attempt, he did not pull any more than three at once at any given time.  I still came quite close to dying at the three-pull, and had to use a healing pot.  He has an obnoxious tendency to swap targets midfight, letting you pull aggro, slowing your heals, not to mention making downing the first enemy take much longer.\
\
Sometimes he will give you enough time to mana up between fights, often not.  Just start drinking right away after each fight and hope.\

The large graphical effect at the top of the hill seems to slow the framerate for some people by a great deal. Once (at level 18) I brought someone to do it with me but they were unable to see what was going on for the hard part.",

It isn't hard, as long as you don't waste mana to anything else than keeping yourself/NPC up.\
\
When he runs to 2-3 elites, you WILL catch aggro of them if you heal the NPC before he has damaged them.\
\
NPC can heal himself aswell, so I didn't start healing before he was below 30%.\
\
The last boss was pretty easy, give the NPC Gift of the Naaru and help him killing the \"boss\".\

Soloing this quest as healer is all about saving mana. :)",

The biggest problem I had was the slow respawn rate and trying to track them down before other players got to them when they respawned.\
\
So, basically, I had a 45% drop rate from the sires and a 25% drop rate from the matriarchs.  Between the two it was 5/13 or roughly 38% drop rate which isn't all that bad.",

If you have this quest when you are doing any of the Mathystra Relics, Tower of Althalaxx, or Gyromast quests, then doing the moonstalkers up north is very close by and rarely in competition with other players.   (In doing this quest on several alts, I've never ever seen someone else up there.)",

I found a great area at [59.8, 11.4] there are so many of the buggers there you have to try hard not to get adds. Also pick up the [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=951]Mathystra Relics[/url] quest as you can pick up the items right around this same area.\
Also the Moonstalker Sires seem to drop the item more then the Matriarchs (for me anyway), I got 3/5 of the pelts from the Sires. The Sires also seem to be lower in level on average then the Matriarchs.\
For the Matriarchs I found a good tactic as a level 20 druid (non-twink, thus crap gear) was to use hibernate on the Matriarchs (normally around level 20) and switch to cat form and take out the runt (normally around level 17) I could make quick work of the runt by itself and still have time left to let my energy refill before the Matriarch woke up and came after me.\

    "9861431521201431522007/08/24 01:07:43VelamatuThis quest can be a menace. Here are a few tips:\
 This quest has an unpredictable drop rate. Typically a bad one.\
 [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=2237]Moonstalker Sire[/url]s and [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=2071]Moonstalker Matriarch[/url] drop the pelts. It is easier to kill the Sires because they do not have adds.\
 The Sires and Matriarchs can be found at 60,12 and 38, 80.\
 If you do this quest at 60,12, pair it with [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=951]Mathystra Relics[/url], [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=2098]Gyromast's Retrieval[/url], [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=2078]Gyromast's Revenge[/url], Tower of Althalaxx ([url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=965]Part 1[/url]) and ([url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=966]Part 2[/url]).\
 If you do this quest at 38,80, pair it with [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1003]Buzzbox 525[/url], [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=948]Onu[/url] (and subsequent quests), and [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=729]The Absent-Minded Prospector[/url] (as well as subsequent quests).\
 Also, if you're lucky and do this quest at 38,80 you may run into the rare spawn [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=2172]Strider Clutchmother[/url].\
\
Also note:\
 This quest requires level eleven and potentially the completion of [url=http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=984]How Big A Threat?[/url]\

\
I've never gotten this quest immediately after arriving in Darkshore, so there may be a prerequisite., but I'm not certain. As I said earlier, I can get this on my Draenei Hunter, so I'm sure it's available.\

\
If you stand at a particular spot. You have the ability to unlock 4 of the five Practice Lockbox's there. (Screenshot Provided).\
\
Just in case. The words \"Practice Lockbox\" will ALWAYS be yellow. The word \"Locked\" changes colors the way Ebonstar says.\
\
You should stay there with the practice boxes until you cannot level your picking skill anymore (when the word \"Locked\" becomes gray). \
\
The boxes respawn very quickly, and sometimes they are booby-trapped. ( I had the Frost Hold Magic trap. )\
\
I was able to gain 101 skill points from this location. I went there with a skill level of 4; and left there with a skill level of 105. Not Bad - Now I go back to the Zoram Strand!\
\
There are numerous creatures outside. But you do not have to worry about them coming in to attack you (at least I did not have to). My stealth was good enough to walk past all creatures - INCLUDING horde. So it is possible to make it there without a fight. In case you are just trying to get your picking skill up.\

The pins are not the actual lockbox locations. But it is the area you should be in. Just be sure to bring something to breath under water with, as the boxes are ALL underwater, and you should have the ability to kill a level 33 mob.\

I am now level 46, and my picking is maxed at 230. The Desolace boxes are still green for me and only take about 4 to give me one skill point.\

Then pickpocket the Malformed Lev24 Defias guard for the key.  He patrols around the tower and is often alone, just wait for opportunity.\

Enter tower in stealth mode. \
Up one level is a guard stationed in center of pathway.  Try to sneak passed her by walking up on the railing to the right (wait for patroling guard to be away). \
\
Even if you alert her, keep going to the right to next landing up.  She will follow but you can easily kill her without alerting patrol guard.  Stealth your way passed dual patrol on 3rd floor and make your way to top floor. \
\
Circle around to the right, chest is on floor near desk.  Sap the boss, the open chest - take book - make a hasty getaway. Or wait for the boss to walk away from the table. Open the box and then restealth. You can jump to first floor and run out - hopefully no guards patrolling out front, or stealth out again.\
\
The poison is easy enough to cure.  As directected talk to Doc in cellar of Barracks. Make sure you type \"/lay\" infront of him.\

I started clearing the area, but I must have aggroed the guard (a Warrior) because Murkdeep came after me. I killed the Warrior, then Gouged him so I could use a Wool Bandage. I used Sinister Strike and Eviscerate on him from there, and he died right when I got the \"Low Health\" message.\
\
So if you're lucky, you'll find Murkdeep already there, and I think he only had 1 guard. If you die, he'll probably just stay there, and it doesn't look like his guards respawn.",

\
For those of you that do not know, advice from hunters should only be tried by hunters (and maybe warlocks). For a very long time now, hunters have been known as the \"solo class\" because they really have two players: the hunter and a meat shield (pet).\
\
Note This!! - Any time a hunter says it can be done and you are not a hunter, it is a totaly different game.\
\
This said, I did complete the quest as a level 15 Shaman. Here's how..\
\
As said above, pulling the mobs in singles or smaller groups is correct. The problem is when facing Murkdeep. Several quests in the game will require you to kill a \"named\" NPC and he/she will almost always have \"bodyguards\". This one is no exception. A hunter above states \"easy to solo lvl 12hunter LOL kiting ftw :D\" and he's full of it. Post the video friend. I would bet he completed the quest in the same way or very similar to the other hunters, sending in pet on a few pulled mobs and letting his \"meat shield\" take the damage. Kiting is not easy and with the new daze mechanics, I would bet all my gold that he did not \"kite\" the mobs (probably doesen't know what kiting is).\

If you have any ranged abilities, start off with those on Murkdeep. I used Lightning after placing a Stoneclaw totem about half way in my cast range. Draenei have a racial HoT (heal over time) that I used after a nice big Nuke on the Murkdeep and I plop a Fire Nova and after plop a Flamtoung. At this point I was at a bit more than half health, my HoT was gone and the bodyguards were about to rush me. I self heal to fill my bar.\
\
Murkdeep is now at 1/4th health, but it's not over yet. I've not done any damage to the guards, so new totems would be toast and Claw tot is on cooldown. I don't have much mana, so I Flame shock, recharge my shield and plop a Stoneskin. The entire time I'm backing up to make distance between me and the guards, I had to be careful not to evade the mobs (another reason kiting is hard here), but being on the brink of evading mobs can be a good thing. A final Earth Shock kills Murkdeep, I now have only 14% health and the guards are wicked pissed. I drop my Earthbind and turn-tail, running further away from the mobs origional spawn point. Sure enough, they evade.\
\
I run up to the corpse of Murkdeep, grab my loot and eat/drink atop his fallen body. Success!\
\
Good Luck and Death to Murkdeep!",

\
So, on my 17 Druid, here is what I did.\
\
Get full health, put on all buffs.  Get as close as possible without aggroing (you can almost get right next to the first cub).  Cast Regrowth and Rejuvenation, blast the mother with Moonfire, then go into Bear Form and start attacking her.  Use Demoralizing Roar and Bash (on her) to help lessen incoming damage.  Keep using Maul as often as possible, and as soon as she dies, turn around and run straight out of the cave and jump off the hill.  Keep going until you leave combat.\
\
I should mention that the fall from the hill will do some damage and may kill you if you're very low on health.  Try to go slightly off to the left side before jumping; it's a shorter distance down in that spot.\
\
I did this as Balance; someone specced for Feral could kill her more quickly and get out sooner.  It's possible that you may get unlucky and be \"stunlocked\" by the bears.  If you see that you're at about 30% and the mother isn't nearly dead, try to run out so you can try again.\
\
It can be difficult, but it's rewarding when you pull it off!  Good luck!",

Unfortunately the Growl was resisted, so I Concussive Shot and Arcane Shot the mum as she run towards me. Run back and sent the pet for her. She aggroed to him, but I had those two cubs up my neck. So I drank the potion, helped the pet kill the mum, then we killed the two remaining cubs.\
\
Somehow like this, perhaps not exactly :) The strategy, however, was to pull two of the cubs first and then when they are dead nuke the mum and see what happens.\

This was easier than it first appeared when looking at the situation. Just clean out the field in front of the cave. This leaves you with 3 mobs: Oaky, his \"bodyguard\", and the cave entrance wanderer.\
\
Pull the wanderer once he's at his furthest point out, no issue here. For my attempt at this quest (and judging from most other posts on here as well) Oaky's \"bodyguard\" isn't linked to him in any way, just pull him as usual with your bow, throwing weapon, Starfire, Smite, etc.\
\
Now, for Oaky himself, he sure didn't seem like an elite, although he was a level below me. Being a Rouge, stealth behind him... get a Backstab off, wait a few moments go gather Energy back, then hit a Gouge, walk behind him and get off another Backstab. At this point, pop Evasion, get off 2 SS's before hitting the finishing move (either one would work, I believe I went with Eviscerate). He was down to about 35% health left, and my Evasion time was almost up. Gather Energy again, and start over from Gouge; he'll be just about dead after the ensuing Backstab/SS.\

No potions or bandages needed, just a little planning for your first \"group\" quest.",

Blood mushrooms are at the base of the trees found along the southern border of the main/larger part of the island - between Kessel's Crossing and Blacksilt Shore (where the murlocs are)... so basically, go west from Kessel's Crossing and search the bases of the trees that are along the southern border.  They are small and glow red.\
\
Ruinous Polyspore can be found all over the ruins of Loreth'Aran, east of Blood Watch.  They are black/grey and tan.\
\
Fel Cone fungus was found at the base of the trees just south of Nazzivian (as well as all over Nazzivian)- look for a large group of reddish pink mushrooms growing together in large clumps, and you'll find the fel cone fungus there.  They're kind of hard to find amongst the other 'shrooms, so drag your mouse over the group until you see the cog wheel.

You'll see a patched, wooden part of the bridge*- stand on that and jump off into Lake Everstill below - jumping off the east side of the bridge into the water.  Swim east and look underwater - beware of level 18 and 19 murlocs.  As you swim east underwater, you'll come to a sunken rowboat.  Keep swimming past it to the second sunken rowboat, and you'll see the chest on the bottom of the lake by the second sunken rowboat.  So basically, jump east off the Lakeshire bridge and swim east, watching underwater for murlocs and the first then second sunken rowboat, and you'll find the sunken chest that contains Oslow's tools there on the bottom near the second sunken rowboat.  Good luck!\

Then, head south on the road to coord. 49.57.  At level 20, I stayed away from any buildings I could see from the road, and didn't run into any guards.

Stay away from the islands as there are murlocs on them. I swam between the islands and did not agro any of them. I stayed deep underwater but surfaced once close to Witch Hill and did not agro any.\

When summoned, Lunaclaw will not aggro the other mobs, so there is no need to clear. You can run into the cave, take the death from the other mobs, it's a relatively short run from the graveyard. Rez on the stone, be sure to buff yourself like I forgot to do, and summon Lunaclaw. \
\
Moonfire, (I tossed Rejuv on myself from the start) and Wrath, rinse and repeat until dead. I popped one Minor Health Pot but that was it. If I'd been buffed I may not have needed that. A relatively easy fight, once you get past the mobs guarding the cave.",

Let your mana regen a bit, then when roots break, re-root and re-moonfire. Back up, repeat as necessary. Just avoid spamming wrath, because it runs you OOM quickly and it gives a chance for the roots to break early.",

This being my first ally druid I didnt have any clue, overpulled and almost wiped on the doomkins outside. They hit quite hard but as long as you only pull 1 at the time you'll be fine.\
\
On Lunaclaw, just run to the exit of the cave so you can root him, then fire off a couple of wrath and a moonfire, root again, wrath and moonfire spam. \

Did this as a level 11, would have worked as level 10 also, no need to run in and die to ress in the cave.",
